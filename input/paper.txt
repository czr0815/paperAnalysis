Moreover, conventional experimental measurement devices cannot provide detailed information on the formation and evolution of the size-number of ultra-fine PMs. Therefore, the formation of ultra-fine PMs during PC char combustion under both atmopspheres with and without FGR are studied by a self-developed Char Burning and Particulate Matters Kinetics model (CBPMK). The PC char shows similar burning temperature and thus ash vaporization rate under both atmospheres, whereas the vaporization amount under oxy-coal combustion atmosphere is lower than that under air combustion atmosphere due to the shortened burnout time caused by CO2 gasification reaction under the former. Consequently, during nucleation and condensation stages (before successive coalescence), both the particle size and number under air combustion atmosphere are higher than those under oxy-coal combustion atmosphere. However, after coalescence, the final particle shows fewer but larger size under oxy-coal combustion atmosphere due to the higher cohesion factor between the smaller sized nucleation particles, which improves particle collision and coalescence. Meanwhile, both mean size and number density of the nucleation particles decrease with increased FGR ratio under both air and oxy-coal combustion atmospheres, however, after coalescence the final PMs show increasing number density and decreasing size. As results, oxy-coal combustion advantages PMs removal through an ash collector, but elevated FGR ratio disadvantages PMs removal. Oxy-coal combustion with low FGR ratio should be recommended in PC thermal and power plants.", "key_words": ["Particulate matters (PMs)", "Flue gas recirculation (FGR)", "Coal char", "Combustion", "Kinetics"], "scp_id": "85042869900"}

Coordinates of primary particles are tracked, which enables simulation of particle morphology and provides more quantities that are directly comparable to experimental observations. Parametric sensitivity study on the computed particle size distributions (PSDs) shows that the rate of production of pyrene and the collision efficiency have the most significant effect on the computed PSDs.

Thermochemical recuperation can be considered as an on-board hydrogen production technology. To determine the efficiency of the thermochemical recuperation system, the thermodynamic analysis via Gibbs free energy minimization method was performed. The software Aspen-HYSYS was used for the thermodynamic analysis. The heat flows were calculated for a wide temperature range from 500 to 1000 K, for steam-to-ethanol ratio from 1 to 3, and for various pressures of 1, 5 and 10 bar. The results of the thermodynamic analysis were compared with the experimental results and the results of the thermodynamic analysis performed by other authors. All obtained results are in a good correlation. In the first law energy analysis was found that for a high steam-to-ethanol ratio (above 3), to perform thermochemical recuperation an external heat must be supplied to the TCR system.

This ventilated PV double-skin façade (PV-DSF) consists of an outside layer of semi-transparent amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV laminate, an inward-openable window and a 400mm airflow cavity. Before installation, the electrical characteristics under standard testing conditions (STC) and the temperature coefficients of the semi-transparent PV module were tested and determined in the laboratory. Field measurements were carried out to investigate the impact of different ventilation modes, namely, ventilated, buoyancy-driven ventilated and non-ventilated, on the thermal and power performances of this PV-DSF. The results show that the ventilated PV-DSF provides the lowest average solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and the non-ventilated PV-DSF provides the best thermal insulation performance. In terms of power performance, the energy output of the ventilated PV-DSF is greater than those of the buoyancy-driven ventilated and non-ventilated PV-DSFs by 1.9% and 3%, respectively, due to its much lower operating temperature. Based on the experimental results, a conclusion was drawn that the ventilation design can not only reduce the heat gain of PV-DSF but also improve the energy conversion efficiency of PV modules by bringing down their operating temperature. In addition, an optimum operation strategy is recommended for this kind of PV-DSF to maximize its overall energy efficiency under different weather conditions.", "key_words": ["Building-integrated photovoltaic", "Double-skin façade", "Solar heat gain coefficient", "Power performance", "Thermal performance"], "scp_id": "84911891601"}

ORC unit under investigation uses R245fa as the working fluid, for which a regression based approach was implemented to evaluate its state properties. Steady and transient models for unit’s subcomponents (pump, evaporator, expander and condenser) were developed. Heat source is considered as solar heated water between 80°C and 95°C at mass flow rates between 2kg/s and 12kg/s, while the flow rate of R245fa is ranging between 0.5kg/s and 1.5kg/s. Due to possible changes in the available thermal energy, unit’s evaporator was identified as the critical component of the ORC. Evaporator’s effectiveness was characterized as a function of inlet temperatures and mass flow rates to map steady operation scenarios for changing conditions. Steady state analysis shows that the selected ORC system is capable of producing 13–39kW power for heat inputs varying between 125kW and 367kW with maximum efficiency in the defined operating range. Subsequently, the developed steady state map is used to construct a control strategy. This strategy aims to adjust evaporator flow rates in order to achieve maximum and steady energy recovery for any given level of heat input. The unit is simulated to study its dynamic response when available thermal energy gradually or abruptly changes with and without the control strategy.

The challenge with buildings’ load prediction is the lack of historical data since not all sites have a large amount of collected data. One of the solutions is incremental learning that updates the trained model with the most recent data. It allows the model to be deployed as soon as possible and improving its prediction accuracy as time progress. This study studies the effect of incremental learning. This study also proposes a novel DB-SOINN-R model that is based on the enhanced self-organizing incremental neural network (ESOINN), which is one of the incremental learning models. The problems with ESOINN are the inappropriate node removal by the original denoising of ESOINN, the inappropriate Euclidean distance for training data with imbalanced dimensions that usually consist of less discrete timestamp data compared to time-series historical data, and the incapability to obtain unique predicted outputs. To tackle these problems, the DB-SOINN-R incorporates a new density-based denoising that replaces the original denoising, a new mean Euclidean distance as the distance metric to handle training data with imbalanced dimensions, and k-nearest-neighbor inverse distance weighting (kNN-IDW) regression to obtain unique predicted output for every different input. The proposed DB-SOINN-R is compared with five models: feedforward neural network, deep neural network with long-short-term memory, support vector regression, ESOINN, and kNN regression.

Analysis of two dimensional (2-D) diffusion of hydrogen is coupled with three dimensional (3-D) stress analysis incorporating cohesive elements. The deleterious effect of hydrogen on crack growth is introduced through the hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism where modification to the cohesive energy is related to local hydrogen concentration. The proposed method is applied to hydrogen-assisted cracking of a circumferentially notched tensile (CNT) specimen under three different conditions of hydrogen supply and its performance is demonstrated through the close agreement between the corresponding computed critical stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the experimental results reported in the literature. The modelling duly accounts for the off-centre precracked ligament usually resulting from fatigue precracking of CNT specimens. The results clearly bring out the non-axisymmetric nature of concentration distribution and stress field, and reveal enhanced hydrogen diffusion at a point on the outer edge of the ligament profile where crack depth is the highest and wherefrom the crack extension is likely to initiate.\n               ", "key_words": ["Cohesive zone modelling", "Hydrogen-assisted cracking", "Circumferentially notched tensile (CNT) specimen", "Three-dimensional model", "AS-4340"]}

The CPP fs CARS technique has previously been used to perform spectroscopic temperature measurements in highly turbulent laboratory burners with excellent accuracy, precision, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution. In this paper, ultrafast CARS measurements in spray flames are presented as part of a larger effort to provide spatially and temporally resolved temperature fields in harsh spray environments. The Sydney Needle Spray Burner (SYNSBURNTM) was used to stabilize turbulent spray flames of acetone and ethanol. The burner features a retractable fuel injector so that the droplet density at the nozzle exit could be systematically varied. Results from selected regions of the turbulent spray flames are discussed in detail to highlight the challenges of CPP fs CARS temperature measurements. Sources of spectral distortion due to interaction with droplets are discussed along with an uncertainty analysis. The passage of fuel through the probe volume caused varying levels of signal degradation and resulted in complete signal loss on approximately 10% of the laser shots for dense spray conditions. The interferences are attributed to two separate phenomena and are categorized based on the probable phase of the fuel – liquid or gas. Interference caused by liquid fuel was unavoidable in certain regions at certain operating conditions, but easily identified and removed. Interference from vapor fuel was more problematic as the nitrogen signal was only moderately corrupted in the high-frequency portion of the spectrum, and the temperature was generally biased to higher values. Rejecting individual signal spectra, based on a fitting error threshold, was shown to be effective in excluding shots with significant interference from fuel droplets, but shots with only minor interference require a more-advanced rejection criterion. Analysis of the temperature fields for a few selected conditions is presented showing trends with the atomization quality of the liquid fuel.

A kinetic model using a parallel reaction mechanism was then developed to predict the thermal decomposition of duckweed. Furthermore, a nonlinear dynamic optimization model was established and coupled with the kinetic model to gain the optimal kinetic parameters for each parallel reaction and achieve good model-fitting.

An activation energy of 62 kJ/mol was determined for the reaction of ball-milled ferrosilicon powder with sodium hydroxide solution, which is around 30 kJ/mol lower than that previously reported for unmilled ferrosilicon. A series of composite powders were also prepared by ball milling ferrosilicon with various additives in order to improve the hydrogen generation properties from ferrosilicon 75 and attempt to activate the silicon in the passivating FeSi2 component. Three different classes of additives were employed: salts, polymers and sugars. The effects of these additives on hydrogen generation from the reaction of ferrosilicon with 2 wt% aqueous sodium hydroxide were investigated. It was found that composites formed of ferrosilicon and sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium polyacrylate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate-co-maleic acid or fructose showed reduced induction times for hydrogen generation compared to that observed for ferrosilicon alone, and all but fructose also led to an increase in the maximum hydrogen generation rate. In light of its low cost and toxicity and beneficial effects, sodium chloride is considered to be the most effective of these additives for activating the silicon in ferrosilicon toward hydrogen generation. Materials characterisation showed that neither ball milling on its own nor use of additives was successful in activating the FeSi2 component of ferrosilicon for hydrogen generation and the improvement in rate and shortening of the induction period was attributed to the silicon component of the mixture alone The gravimetric storage capacity for hydrogen in ferrosilicon 75 is therefore maintained at only 3.5% rather than the 10.5% ideally expected for a material containing 75% silicon.

We therefore map temperature, CO, and H2 for geometries and conditions relevant to burners in domestic boiler systems, to assess the potential hazard of CO release into the ambient atmosphere, should any partial quenching occur. CO concentrations peaks of 5.5 volume % are recorded in the core surrounding the axis. Appreciable CO concentrations are also found in the absence of added air. Experiments on various burner port geometries and temperatures suggest that this is not due to air entrainment at the flame base but to diffusion from zones closer to the flame. Next, quenching surfaces such as grids, perforated plates and flame trap matrices of different metals are progressively lowered into the flame. To avoid flow line distortion, suction aspirates the quenched products. The highest emission rate occurs with the quenching plane some 4mm above the burner; further lowering of the quenching surface causes flame extinction. The maximum CO release is close to converting 10% of the CH4 feed, with some variation with quenching material. Expressing this potential release in terms of, e.g. boiler power, predicts a potentially serious hazard.

In the presence of chloroform (100–900 mg CH3Cl/L), the mixture (LEMW:FWL = 40:60) exhibited a much higher tolerance than that of LEMW alone, which could be ascribed to the co-metabolic degradation of chloroform by FWL addition.

Energy policy involves a number of stakeholders, and needs to incorporate the interests and requirements of all the key stakeholder groups. This paper presents a methodological technique to assist with formulating, evaluating, and promoting the energy policy of a country in a transparent and representative way with clear scientific justifications and balanced assessments. The multicriteria decision analysis approach has been a widely used technique for evaluating different alternatives based on the interests of a multitude of stakeholders, and goals. This paper utilizes the SMAA (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis) tool, which can evaluate different alternatives by incorporating multiple criteria, in order to examine the preferences of different policy elements. We further extend this technique by incorporating the LEAP model (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system) to assess the emission impacts of different policy elements. We demonstrate the application of this evaluation technique by an analysis of four hypothetical policy elements namely Business-as usual (BAU), Renewables (REN), Renewable-biomass only (REN-b), and Energy conservation and efficient technologies (ECET). These are applied to the case of sharing fuel sources for power generation for the Bangladesh power sector. We found that the REN-b and REN policy elements were the best and second best alternatives with 41% and 32% acceptability respectively.

However, the wind speed time series always exhibits nonlinear and non-stationary features, making it very difficult to be predicted accurately. Recognizing this challenge, a novel deep learning based approach is proposed for deterministic and probabilistic WSF. The approach is a hybrid of wavelet transform (WT), deep belief network (DBN) and spine quantile regression (QR). WT is employed to decompose raw wind speed data into different frequency series with better behaviors. The nonlinear features and invariant structures of each frequency are completely extracted by layer-wise pre-training based DBN. Then, the uncertainties in wind speed are statistically synthesized via the QR method. Case studies using real wind farm data from China and Australia have been presented. The comparative results demonstrate that the high-level nonlinear and non-stationary feature in the wind speed series can be learned better, and competitive performance can thus be obtained. It is therefore convinced that the proposed method has a high potential for practical applications in electric power and energy systems.\n               ", "key_words": ["Deep belief network", "Wind speed forecast", "Deep learning", "Quantile regression", "Wavelet transform"], "scp_id": "84983752516", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "285"}

Ethylene was injected transversely from an orifice to the supersonic flow of Mach 2 with a stagnation temperature of 1900 K and a total pressure of 0.37 MPa. The dynamic pressure, CH* chemiluminescence and shadowgraph images were measured with a pressure sensor and a high-speed video camera. Dynamic pressure was analyzed by fast Fourier transform, and time-resolved CH* chemiluminescence images were modally decomposed by the sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition (SP-DMD). The results indicated that two combustion instabilities were observed for cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion and the oscillation between jet-wake stabilized and cavity shear-layer ram combustions for the power spectral density (PSD) of pressure. In the case of the combustion instability of cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, a dominant peak of approximately 128 Hz was observed for the PSD of pressure. This instability corresponded to an entire flame oscillation of the cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, which was validated by the SP-DMD and a low rank reproduction with 10 modes. This was driven by a fuel injection oscillation in the injection orifice. In the case of oscillation between the jet-wake stabilized and the cavity shear-layer ram combustions, peaks around 1600 Hz were observed for the PSD of pressure. This mechanism was also explained by the SP-DMD modes and a low rank reproduction using within 10 modes. The DMD and shadowgraph images indicated that the vortex formed by a separation of the boundary layer induced a strong jet-wake flame, resulting in the temporal thermal choke followed by cavity shear-layer stabilized ram combustion.

It is found that successful cold start from −20 °C can be achieved with the assist of the catalytic reaction in galvanostatic mode. With anode catalytic reaction, the start-up current density must be moderate, because a high current density lowers the assisted heating effect, and a low current density slows down the start-up process. The temperature difference between the anode and cathode catalyst layers (CLs) is negligible, which indicates that the heating location in the electrodes for the catalytic reaction makes no significant difference.

The aim is to develop a methodology that can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine the compression condition of DI Diesel engines. However, conclusions derived from the present investigation can be extrapolated to other types of reciprocating internal combustion engines. The compression stroke itself is an important index concerning engine operation since engine conditions at the end of the compression stroke have a major effect on its overall performance. Such information is especially important for large scale Diesel engines used for stationary or marine applications. In these engines, it is important to develop non-catastrophic methods for estimating the cylinder compression condition without dismantling the engine cylinder. The outcome could be a serious reduction of maintenance costs, since unnecessary labour required for inspection could be avoided. When using measurement techniques, what is usually available is the cylinder pressure trace during the compression stroke. However, it is widely recognized that the compression stroke and peak compression pressure is strongly affected, beyond heat losses, by the initial pressure at the inlet valve closure, the compression ratio and the blowby rate. The last three parameters can vary significantly during engine operation, while the heat losses vary mainly due to engine operating conditions and their effect on the compression stroke can be considered. Thus, the knowledge of the peak compression pressure resulting from the cylinder compression pressure diagram is not adequate to define the cylinder compression condition. For this reason, an experimental investigation is conducted to examine the effect of the initial pressure at the inlet valve closure, the compression ratio and the blowby on the cylinder pressure trace. From analysis of the measured data, it is revealed that each parameter has a different effect on the different parts of the compression pressure trace.

A holistic passive design approach combining a variance-based factor prioritizing and surrogate model based multi-objective optimization was previously proposed to explore the green building solution in the hot and humid climate of Hong Kong. The design approach is further extended for application into a broader spectrum of climates across the mainland of China, including the severe cold zone, cold zone, hot summer cold winter zone, temperate zone as well as hot summer warm winter zone. The relative weight analysis is first compared with the Fourier Amplitude Transformation Analysis (FAST) in prioritizing the weighting of design inputs for different climatic zones.

Furthermore, a tuning program in R is developed to improve the prediction performance of surrogate models with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm under above climatic zones. The model fitting performance with SVM is proved to be greatly improved by modifying the Sigma and C parameters.

This demonstrates the existence of one or more significant anthropogenic sources, a fact that has generated considerable research interest over the last several years. The debate has principally focused on (1) the identity of the sources, and (2) the consequences of increased N2O concentrations. Both questions remain open, to at least some degree.\n                  The environmental concerns stem from the suggestion that diffusion of additional N2O into the stratosphere can result in increased ozone (O3) depletion. Within the stratosphere, N2O undergoes photolysis and reacts with oxygen atoms to yield some nitric oxide (NO). This enters into the well known O3 destruction cycle. N2O is also a potent absorber of infrared radiation and can contribute to global warming through the greenhouse effect.\n                  A major difficulty in research on N2O is measurement. Both electron capture gas chromatography and continuous infrared methods have seen considerable development, and both can be used reliably if their limitations are understood and appropriate precautions are taken. In particular, the ease with which N2O is formed from NO in stored combustion products must be recognized; this can occur even in the lines of continuous sampling systems.\n                  In combustion, the homogeneous reactions leading to N2O are principally NCO + NO → N2O + CO and NH + NO → N2O + H, with the first reaction being the most important in practical combustion systems. Recent measurements have resulted in a revised rate for this reaction, and the suggestion that only a portion of the products may branch into N2O + CO. Alternatively, recent measurements also suggest a reduced rate for the N2O + OH destruction reaction. Most modeling has been based on the earlier kinetic information, and the conclusions derived from these studies need to be revisited.\n                  In high-temperature combustion, N2O forms early in the flame if fuel-nitrogen is available. The high temperatures, however, ensure that little of this escapes, and emissions from most conventional combustion systems are quite low. The exception is combustion under moderate temperature conditions, where the N2O is formed from fuel-nitrogen, but fails to be destroyed. The two principal examples are combustion fluidized beds, and the downstream injection of nitrogen-containing agents for nitrogen oxide (NO\n                        x\n                     ) control (e.g., selective noncatalytic reduction with urea).\n                  There remains considerable debate on the degree to which homogeneous vs heterogeneous reactions contribute to N2O formation in fluidized bed combustion. What is clear is that the N2O yield is inversely proportional to bed temperature, and conversion of fuel-nitrogen to N2O is favored for higher-rank fuels. Fixed-bed studies on highly devolatilized coal char do not indicate a significant role for heterogeneous reactions involving N2O destruction. The reduction of NO at a coal char surface appears to yield significant N2O only if oxygen (O2) is also present. Some studies show that the degree of char devolatilization has a profound influence on both the yield of N2O during char oxidation, and on the apparent mechanism. Since the char present in combustion fluidized beds will likely span a range of degrees of devolatilization, it becomes difficult to conclusively sort purely homogeneous behavior from potential heterogeneous contributions in practical systems.\n                  Formation of N2O during NO\n                        x\n                      control processes has primarily been confined to selective noncatalytic reduction. Specifically, when the nitrogen-containing agents urea and cyanuric acid are injected, a significant portion (typically > 10%) of the NO that is reduced is converted into N2O. The use of promoters to reduce the optimum injection temperature appears to increase the fraction of NO converted into N2O. Other operations, such as air staging and reburning, do not appear to be significant N2O producers. In selective catalytic reduction the yield of N2O depends on both catalyst type and operating condition, although most systems are not large emitters.\n                  Other systems considered include mobile sources, waste incineration, and industrial sources. In waste incineration, the combustion of sewage sludge yields very high N2O emissions. This appears to be due to the very high nitrogen content of the fuel and the low combustion temperatures. Many industrial systems are largely uncharacterized with respect to N2O emissions. Adipic acid manufacture is known to produce large amounts of N2O as a by-product, and abatement procedures are under development within the industry.\n               ", "key_words": null, "scp_id": "0028576335", "affil": [{"affilname": "United States Environmental Protection Agency", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "University of Washington", "contry": "United States"}], "citedby_count": "158"}

The state-of-the-art processes for the synthesis of methanol from COG possess several limitations such as poor utilization of hydrogen, low yields, and high energy consumption, leading to high production cost. The main technical issues are poor carbon supply and the need for energy intensification of the process. In this paper, we propose a new, more efficient method for the conversion of COG and pulverized coke (PC) into methanol and ammonia using chemical looping of hydrogen generation (CLHG), (PCCLHG-CGTMA). The PCCLHG-derived H2 and N2 are utilized for ammonia production. The new process has high adjustability in the production of methanol and ammonia. In order to obtain the best performance of carbon and hydrogen elements utilization efficiency, exergy and energy efficiency, several operational parameters and conditions have been optimized. Compared with different technologies for the conversion of COG to methanol or ammonia, the new system acclaims an excellent hydrogen element utilization efficiency of 88.8% and a high exergy efficiency of 78.7%. And the relative CO2 reduction ratio of this new system is 0.67. Considering the current market value and demands, 0.576 Mt/y COG and 0.175 Mt/y PC could be utilized in this process for the production of 0.44–0.86 Mt/y methanol and 0–0.36 Mt/y of ammonia.

In this work, a two-stage interaction mechanism is proposed through CO2 absorption performance, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, and quantum calculation. The experimental results and quantum calculation revealed that the shift of the absorption mechanism depended on the active amine group in the biphasic solvents. In the first stage, for a high concentration of the active amine group, a proton was transferred from zwitterion to tertiary amines with the primary amines as intermediates. The CO2 absorption rate was controlled by reaction kinetics, which resulted in a high absorption rate and inconspicuous phase change. In the second stage, for a low concentration of the active amine group, the thermodynamics-controlled absorption rate decreased sharply (by 65.2% for 1,4-butanediamine/N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine) because the proton transferred from zwitterion to tertiary amines directly.

Here important points are that the solid fuel is fixed at each position and that any movable burnup reactivity control mechanisms such as control rods are not required. This burnup strategy can derive many merits. The change of excess reactivity along burnup is theoretically zero, and shim rods will not be required for this reactor. The reactor becomes free from accidents induced by unexpected control rods withdrawal. The core characteristics, such as power feedback coefficients and power peaking factor, are not changed along burnup. Therefore the operation of the reactor becomes much easier than the conventional reactors especially for high burnup reactors. The transportation and storage of replacing fuels become easy and safe, since they are free from criticality accidents. Application of this burnup strategy to neutron rich fast reactors makes excellent performances. Only natural or depleted uranium is required for the replacing fuels.

However, in spite of the advantages associated with ANG over other storage modes, there are some issues that need be properly addressed in order to ensure a viable employment of such alternative. One major problem is that the thermal effects associated with the sorption phenomena tend to diminish the storage capacity, thereby resulting in poorer performance. Hence, in order to design commercially viable storage vessels, the heat and mass transfer mechanisms that occur in these devices must be carefully understood and controlled. With the purpose of improving the understanding of mass and energy transport within ANG vessels, dimensionless groups associated with this problem have been developed in this study, resulting in an innovation to the ANG literature. Along with the dimensionless groups, a lumped-capacitance formulation has been also proposed. Although this type of formulation is limited compared to the multi-dimensional formulations present in the literature, its computational solution is remarkably faster. Numerical solution results using the proposed lumped formulation are compared with those of a previous study, suggesting that the simpler model can be applied to larger process times. The process of charging and discharging ANG vessels was then simulated employing the proposed formulation for different combinations of the developed dimensionless groups. In order to properly assess charge and discharge processes, a performance coefficient was employed. The results show that increasing the heat capacity ratio and dimensionless heat transfer coefficient tend to augment the performance coefficient, whereas an increase in the dimensionless heat of sorption worsens performance.

This paper presents, evaluates, and compares soiling rates and losses in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (Equatorial Tropical: 19.92° S, 43.99° W), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul (Humid-Subtropical: 30.05° S, 51.17° W), and Brotas de Macaúbas, Bahia (Semi-Arid: 12.00° S, 42.63° W). The results show that soiling is moderate in all 3-regions, for example with 0.1%/day < SRate < 0.2%/day for Belo Horizonte. Precipitation dominates the cleaning of the modules in the summertime in this climate zone, while it is the major factor year-round in Rio Grande do Sul. Wind is the major issue mitigating the soiling accumulation for the Bahia installation. The methodology incorporates several key refinements, including the normalization and adjustment for the meteorological parameters (temperature, irradiance, wind, precipitation). The evaluations include the region-specific differing effects of non-uniform soiling, natural cleaning, and ambient temperatures.", "key_words": ["Climate", "PV Modules", "Soiling station", "Soiling ratio", "Soiling rate"], "scp_id": "85107122850", "affil": [{"affilname": "Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Minas Gerais", "contry": "Brazil"}, {"affilname": "University of Colorado Boulder", "contry": "United States"}], "citedby_count": "0"}

The experimental results show that, the laminar burning velocity is enhanced by the increase in the reactant temperature, irrespective of the equivalence ratio of the mixture. Addition of coal particles in fuel lean (ϕ <1) mixtures increases the laminar burning velocity initially, but after a certain concentration of dust addition this trend is altered. The dust concentration value, where this variation is observed, increases with increase in reactant temperature. In other words, the reactant temperature plays a significant role in the trend of increase in laminar burning velocity with dust addition. For ϕ ⩾1, at a given reactant temperature, a linear decay of burning velocity with dust addition is observed. When a combustible dust particle interacts with the flame zone, it extracts energy from the flame and releases volatiles, thereby changing the equivalence ratio. This local increase in the equivalence ratio and the heat sink effect, are found to be influenced by the reactant temperature. A mathematical model including these effects is developed and the model predictions are compared with the experimental results. The results are in a good agreement for fuel lean and stoichiometric mixtures; whereas the model is found to under predict results for fuel rich cases.", "key_words": ["Burning velocity", "Particle", "Premixed flame", "Volatilization", "Coal"], "affil": null, "citedby_count": "10"}

Results show that the PV plant with an inverter can generate power at the lowest cost but with poor reliability. The combination of the CSP plant and PV plant is an effective way to improve power generation reliability economically. When low investment costs of PV plant, battery, and inverter are adopted, the battery is preferentially integrated into PV plant to reduce the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) to a certain level.

Experiments were performed at various pressure ratios (3.3–4.1) over the expander and flooding ratios (0–0.3) with R1233zd(E) as the working fluid and a standard lubricant oil as the flooding medium. The data reduction and uncertainty analysis were also discussed in depth. In total, 142 steady-state points were obtained.

The maximum enhancement of the isothermal efficiency of the expander was 9.5%. Results also showed that the expander power output, the net power output and the thermal efficiency were enhanced with the increase of the flooding liquid amount. The potential of an organic Rankine cycle system with liquid-flooded expansion can be further examined if over-expansion losses can be reduced and larger amount of oil can be injected, i.e., with higher pressure ratios and higher flooding ratios.

A wide test matrix was performed in an optically accessible hot-spray test rig to understand the influence that partial needle lift and alternative injection rate shapes have on the Diesel ignition The results showed that alternative injection rate profiles have a substantial impact on the ignition event affecting the premixed phase of the combustion and the location where the ignition takes place. Moreover, the results proved that the modifications in the internal flow caused by the partial needle lift are reflected on the ignition timing: although partial needle lift and injection pressure have similar effects on the mass flow rate, in the first case, the ignition delay is reduced, while in the second, the combustion is delayed as a consequence of a different spray development.", "key_words": ["Rate-shaping", "Direct-acting", "Diesel ignition", "Partial needle-lift", "Chemiluminescence"], "scp_id": "84891756282"}

Experiments were conducted for evaporation temperatures ranging from 125 °C to 150 °C and condensation temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 40 °C. The performance of the reciprocating piston expander was investigated in terms of the torque of the expander, pressure inside the cylinder, isentropic efficiency of the expander, and net power produced by the expander.

This paper proposes an alternative operating strategy called flue gas reinjecting (FGR) for a CCHP system consisting of a small-scale gas turbine, a double-effect absorption chiller and a hot water exchanger. The FGR operating strategy elevates the compressor inlet temperature by reinjecting a portion of the flue gas into the ambient air, which seems to contradict the well-proven concept of gas turbine inlet air cooling. In contrast, improving inlet air temperature cannot obviously influence the off-design performance of the gas turbine, and more high-temperature flue gas is produced in the gas turbine, which leads to more cooling and heating output in the absorption chiller and hot water exchanger, respectively. To extend the power output range (100–20%), reducing the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) operating strategy is introduced as an auxiliary means. The off-design performance of the CCHP system is investigated under the combined FGR and TIT operating strategy and independent TIT operating strategy. It is found that improved total efficiency and energy saving performance of the CCHP system are presented with the combined operating strategy at partial load. At a load rate of 50% (876kW), the fuel energy saving ratio (FESR) increases from 20.52% to 22.96% as the temperature of the inlet air is increased from 25 to 45°C using the combined operation strategy. The exhaust gas reinjection reduces the excess air resulting in inhibition of the formation of NOX in the combustor. Moreover, using the proposed operating strategy contributes to promoting more effective utilization of low-temperature heat and the direct blending of two fluids reduces heat and pressure losses emanating from the heat exchanger.

The good agreement of test and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the numerical model and the feasibility of test device including its control and measurement systems. Then a novel characterization method called quasi-steady-state method is first proposed to fast and precisely derive the module-level temperature-dependent thermoelectric parameters including Seebeck coefficient S, thermal conductivity λ and electrical resistivity ρ. The characterization procedure is to raise the temperature of the thermoelectric module’s hot side at an appropriate heating rate and keep the chiller at a constant temperature both in open and short circuit tests in sequence. The thermoelectric leg is regarded as multiple serial segments divided according to its temperature distribution. One set of equations involving the thermo- and electro- variables is established for each segment in case of a certain temperature difference. All these equations are solved by means of an iterative algorithm and computed by MATLAB. S and λ are obtained by open circuit tests and ρ by the short circuit tests subsequently. The comparison of estimated thermoelectric parameters by tests, simulations and the manufacturer’s data validate the correctness of the quasi-steady-state method and its predictability ability of the performance of thermoelectric generators in practice.", "key_words": ["Thermoelectric generator module", "Simulation model", "Test measurements", "Quasi-steady-state", "Characterization method"]}

Buildings being one of the largest consumers of energy can help address this issue in various ways. The objective of the present study is to simulate and optimize a photovoltaic-based energy system integrated with onsite battery and electric vehicles for a demo site in Belgium in the Central European climatic conditions. The energy system of the demo site consists of photovoltaic-thermal panels, providing electricity and heat to the building, a battery as well as several long- and short-term thermal storages to reduce electricity curtailment and import. In the present study, the focus is on the optimization of the electric vehicle and battery charging and the import from the electrical network. Monitored data from the demo site is processed using a machine learning method to identify overproduction curtailment and electric vehicle charging events and to generate profiles of the photovoltaic (PV) energy production, feasible time windows and energy requirements for electric vehicle charging and building’s energy demand. These profiles and data are then used in an optimization method using linear and mixed integer programming to minimize the annual cost of the purchased electricity. Different case studies in terms of PV capacity, battery capacity and electric vehicle charging scenarios are investigated to compare against the performance of the real system. Various criteria, such as the curtailment of the PV production, imported energy cost, onsite energy fraction and matching indicators and lastly the net-zero energy balance of the building are considered to compare the results of the case studies. The study shows that machine learning can be used for the investigation of the monitored data, which can be later used for simulating and optimizing the case studies. The results shows that PV panels with 20 kWp (PV generation to demand ratio of 97%) and battery capacity of 16.1 kWh can result in annual energy cost saving of up to 807€ (31% reduction) with PV curtailment ratio of 34%, compared with the installed real demo building that has 10 kWp PV panels (PV generation to demand ratio of 49%) and battery capacity of 32.2 kWh. This would lead to an increase in the onsite-energy fraction indicator from 45% to 68%. Moreover, this combination can bring the building closer to the net-zero energy balance if the surplus electricity is exported rather than being curtailed. The optimization of the energy system in terms of equipment sizing and operation control is needed to increase the techno-economic performance of the whole system.", "key_words": ["Net-zero energy building", "Solar energy", "Energy storage", "Electric vehicle", "Experimental analysis", "Machine learning"], "scp_id": "85088019129", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "5"}

These gains have come about through a combination of improved well and hydraulic fracturing design, and a greater concentration of drilling activity in higher quality acreage, the so called “sweets spots.” Accurate assessment of the future potential of shale and tight resources depends on properly disentangling the influence of technology from that of well location and the associated geology, but this remains a challenge. This paper describes how regression analysis of the impact of design choices on well productivity can yield highly erroneous estimates if spatial dependence is not controlled for at a sufficiently high resolution. Two regression approaches, the spatial error model and regression-kriging, are advanced as appropriate methods and compared to simpler but widely used regression models with limited spatial fidelity. A case study in which these methods are applied to a large contemporary well dataset from the Williston Basin in North Dakota reveals that only about half of the improvement in well productivity is associated with technology changes, but the simpler regression models substantially overestimate the impact of technology by attributing location-driven improvement to design changes. Because of the widespread reliance on these less spatially resolved regression models, including by the U.S. Energy Information Administration to project shale gas and tight oil resource potential, the overestimate of technology’s role in well productivity has important implications for future resource availability and economics, and the development choices of individual operators.", "key_words": ["Hydraulic fracturing", "Unconventional oil and gas", "Bakken and Three Forks Shale", "Spatial autocorrelation", "Linear regression", "Kriging"], "scp_id": "85015791446", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "28"}

Hybrid utilization of wind and solar generators are preferred to reduce the intermittency of output power. Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) have to be sized optimally in the design stage. In this regard, wind speed and solar irradiation data have to be measured and collected at short intervals and for at least one year at the site location, which means a delay in the design and construction of HRES. The purpose of this paper is to eliminate the need for detailed and long-term data in the HRES sizing process by replacing wind speed and solar irradiation data with averaged and usually-available values of meteorological parameters of the site, e.g., air temperature, elevation, relative humidity, roughness length, latitude, longitude, and precipitation. In this paper, the size of the wind/photovoltaic/battery/diesel HRES is estimated as a function of site parameters using polynomial regression and support vector regression models. 105 sites from Iran have been studied as training data to build these models and test them. Sensitivity analysis shows that estimation accuracy increases by increasing training data. Thus, it is expected that by using a sufficient number of training data with global distribution, the accuracy of the models approach the accuracy of current optimal sizing methods while the time-consuming wind speed and solar radiation data collection have been eliminated in the proposed method. For example, by increasing the training data from 40 to 100 sites, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of estimating the HRES size reduced by 2.3 to 3.5 times.", "key_words": ["Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES)", "Wind/photovoltaic/battery/diesel energy system", "Fast sizing", "Size estimation", "Meteorological parameters"], "scp_id": "85101933477", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "8"}

The synthesized catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption, XRD, SEM-EDS, DRIFTS, XPS, TGA-DTA, and Raman spectroscopy analysis. The mesoporous γ-Al2O3 catalyst support exhibited a high surface area of 245 m2/g and average pore volume of 0.481 cm3/g. The DRIFTS results indicate the existence of large Lewis's acid regions in the pure γ-Al2O3 and metal-containing catalysts. Catalytic activity tests of pure materials and metal-containing catalysts were carried out at the reaction temperature of 750 °C and a feed molar ratio of AA/H2O/Ar:1/2.5/2 over 3 h. Complete conversion of acetic acid and 81.75% hydrogen selectivity were obtained over the catalyst 5Ni@γ-Al2O3. The temperature and feed molar ratio had a noticeable impact on H2 selectivity and acetic acid conversion. Increasing the water proportion in the feed composition from 2.5 to 10 considerably improved the catalytic activity by increasing hydrogen selectivity from 81.75% to 91%. Although the Ni-based γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts exhibited higher activity performance compared to the Ni-based MgO-supported catalysts, they were not as resistant to coke formation as were MgO-supported catalysts. The introduction of MgO and La2O3 into the Ni@γ-Al2O3 and Ni@MgO catalysts' structures played a significant role in lowering the carbon formation (from 37.15% to 17.6%–12.44% and 12.17%, respectively) and improving the thermal stability of the catalysts by decreasing the agglomeration of acidic sites and reinforcing the adsorption of CO2 on the catalysts' surfaces.

The pyrolysis behaviors of materials after pretreatments have been studied using thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy. During the pretreatments, OH, CO/CH, SO and CO functional groups in Enteromorpha were cleaved. Phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid made the intensities of the absorption peaks of OH and SO decrease the most obvious, respectively. Therefore, there was almost no NO2 and SO2 emission in the process of pyrolysis of Enteromorpha washed by hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid. The volatile components of Enteromorpha were easy to evolve after the pretreatment.

These alloys have analogical gaseous capabilities, however they exhibit distinct electrochemical performances. High-rate dischargeabilities (HRD) of the alloys with different phase constitution and grain size due to various prepared routes were mainly focused. The as-quenched (RQ) alloy with the most fine microstructure possesses excellent cycling stability, but poor discharge capacity and HRD. Annealing on the as-quenched alloy (the QA alloy) suppresses the electrochemical cycling stability, but dramatically elevates HRD. However, the converse trend is observed in the as-cast alloy that HRD becomes even worse after annealing. Mechanism of HRD is considered based on the electrochemical kinetics and synergetic effects of the multiphase microstructure. Fine microstructure is favorable to the hydrogen diffusion ability, but contributes to higher charge-transfer resistance. Furthermore, fine grains lead to transition of the hydrogen storage mechanism from funneling mode to synergetic mode which promotes the catalytic effects of LaNi5. Thus, the excellent HRD of the as-cast alloy results from the fast electrochemical kinetics. High HRD of the QA alloy is caused by the advantageous synergetic mode, while the sluggish HRD of the RQ alloy is due to the large electrochemical impedance which is strongly more than the other alloys.\n               ", "key_words": ["RE-Mg-Ni based electrode alloys", "High rate dischargeability", "Multiphase microstructure", "Electrochemical kinetics", "Hydrogen storage mechanism"]}

One of the key arguments for decarbonizing the gas network is to take advantage of existing network infrastructure, gradually transitioning to lower fossil carbon sources of methane from Power-to-Gas.\n                  This work proposes the techno-economic investigation of an integrated system considering an advanced CO2 capture process, in terms of solvent and process configuration, to treat about 10% of a cement plant’s flue gas and convert the captured CO2 into synthetic natural gas using renewable hydrogen generated from a large-scale wind powered electrolyzer. An optimized heat recovery system is proposed, drastically decreasing the external hot utility demand of the CO2 capture unit. In addition, it leads to the production of complementary electricity (about 1.06 MW), reducing thus also the electrical demand of the integrated process.\n                  The synthetic natural gas produced has a composition (CH4 92.9 mol.%, CO2 3.7 mol.%, and H2 3.4 mol.%) and a Wobbe index (46.72 MJ/m3), corresponding to specification for gas grid injection at 50 bar in Germany. With an overall system efficiency of 72.6%, the process produces 0.40 ton synthetic natural gas per ton of captured CO2. The cost of the synthetic natural gas produced is higher when compared to the present natural gas market price, but cost reductions and possible commercial use of coproducts like oxygen, represent a likely alternative. Costs are mainly driven by high capital investments (the electrolyzer), and the price of renewable electricity, which is expected to decrease in the coming years.\n               ", "key_words": ["Carbon capture and utilization", "Power-to-gas", "Process simulation", "Techno-economic evaluation", "Heat integration"], "scp_id": "85076602496", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "15"}

These range from benign auto-ignition, with pressure waves of small amplitude, to super-knock with the generation of damaging over-pressures. Results of such simulations are generalised diagrammatically, by plotting boundary values of ξ, the ratio of acoustic to auto-ignition velocity, against ɛ. This latter parameter is the residence time of the developing acoustic wave in the hot spot of radius ro , namely ro/a, normalised by the excitation time for the chemical heat release, τe . This ratio controls the energy transfer into the developing acoustic front. A third relevant parameter involves the product of the activation temperature, E/R, for the auto-ignition delay time, τi , normalised by the mixture temperature. T, the ratio, τi /τe , and the dimensionless hot spot temperature gradient, ( ∂ ln T / ∂ r ¯ ) , where r ¯ is a dimensionless radius. These parameters define the boundaries of regimes of thermal explosion, subsonic auto-ignition, developing detonations, and non-auto-ignitive deflagrations, in plots of ξ against ɛ.The regime of developing detonation forms a peninsula and contours, throughout the field. The product parameter ( E / R T ) ( τ i / τ e ) / ∂ ln T / ∂ r ¯ expresses the influences of hot spot temperature gradient and fuel characteristics, and a unique value of it might serve as a boundary between auto-ignitive and deflagrative regimes. Other combustion regimes can also be identified, including a mixed regime of both auto-ignitive and “normal” deflagrative burning.

A contribution exacerbated by its ageing stock of which only 7% is considered new-build. Consequently, the government has set regulations to decrease the amount of energy take-up by buildings which currently favour deep energy retrofitting analysis for decision-making and demonstrating compliance. Due to the size and complexity of non-domestic buildings, identifying optimal retrofit packages can be very challenging. The need for effective decision-making has led to the wide adoption of artificial intelligence in the retrofit strategy design process. However, the vast retrofit solution space and high time-complexity of energy simulations inhibit artificial intelligence’s application.

The aim of the model is to provide a rapid energy performance estimation engine for assisting multi-objective optimisation of non-domestic buildings energy retrofit planning. The study lays out the process of model development from the investigation of requirements and feature extraction to the application on a case study. It employs sensitivity analysis methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature set in covering retrofit technologies.

But it is one of the most prone to fail components in the wind energy system. The thermal management has been proved to be a cost-effective mean to improve the reliability of wind energy system, but it has a dual nature. To balance the benefit and risk of thermal management, a lifetime extension strategy is proposed. This strategy considers the minimum junction temperature fixed to the lowest ambient temperature and the allowed maximum junction temperature determined by the predefined temperature swing. Then the related wind speeds of predefined temperature swing can be concentrated in a part wind speed area and the effectiveness of thermal management under each predefined temperature swing is calculated. The optimal effectiveness is chosen as a quantitative evaluation criterion to design the working range of thermal management and control target of junction temperature in a long time scale. As a benefit, the economic performance of thermal management is greatly improved in that each application of temperature control can reduce as much consumed lifetime of power module as possible. Case studies and experiments are presented for performance verification of proposed strategy. Results show that the consumed lifetime reduced by each application of temperature control is 6.04 × 10-3%. The expected lifetime of power module is extended from 7.55 years to 22.08 years which meets the target lifetime of wind power generation system (20 years).

The studied perovskites showed suitable redox properties for energy storage in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in presence of air, although only the Co-perovskite material (LSC) exhibited cyclability capacity.

We optimised the controller towards minimum degradation and electricity costs over its lifetime, while ensuring the delivery of frequency control services compliant with regulatory requirements. We adopted a detailed battery model, considering the dynamics and degradation when exposed to actual frequency data. Further, we used a stochastic optimisation objective while constraining the probability on unavailability to deliver the frequency control service.

The present study investigates unscavenged prechamber combustion of lean methane/air mixtures in a Rapid Compression Expansion Machine (RCEM) by combining optical diagnostics (high-speed OH*-chemiluminescence and Schlieren imaging) and 3D Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. Data from the former is used to develop and validate the modeling approach for the specific application and the latter aims to provide indispensable interpretation of the experimental observations. Initially, the comparison of the Schlieren and the OH* images confirm the hypothesis that inherent reacting flame jets exit the prechamber, which justifies the applicability of a level set combustion modeling framework for the investigated operating conditions. The employed G-equation combustion model has been extended to account for the specifics of spark ignition and flame wall interaction present in the prechamber configuration studied. Validation of the developed model by means of the experimental data shows good agreements in terms of (i) jet exit timing, (ii) main chamber heat release rate (HRR) and (iii) projected reactive flame area, evidencing encouraging predictive capability of the proposed modeling approach. The combined insights from experiments and CFD simulations suggest two phases of the main chamber heat release rate, dominated by the jet penetration and the turbulent flame propagation respectively. The subsequent analysis on a single flame jet, using OH*-chemiluminescence and CFD images, indicates that the jet head tends to be more reactive due to a higher turbulence levels and larger eddy size. Moreover, the entire dataset reveals an inverse correlation between the initial reactive jet speed and the early phase combustion duration (5% of total cumulative heat release).

The variation of flame propagation speed with the SMD was determined. Results showed that the change of the flame propagation speed with the SMD had a maximum for a constant equivalence ratio.

Therefore, all experimental data could be arranged on one curve when the lateral axis was taken as the spacing between droplets divided by the flame diameter.

Potential energy intensity change and technological progress were the dominant contributors responsible for lowering energy intensity. In addition to conventional factors, the new provided six factors also have important impacts on energy intensity during the study years. First, the output-oriented industrial technological gap facilitated to lower energy intensity, while the energy-oriented industrial technological gap slightly impeded energy intensity decline. Second, the regional technological gap impeded energy intensity decline, indicating that China’s efforts of regional equilibrium development failed to narrow the energy-saving technology gap between regions. Third, energy-oriented pure technical efficiency decreased energy intensity, while output-oriented pure technical efficiency increased energy intensity.

The equivalence ratio was varied to promote self-excited oscillations, with the oscillation frequency, heat release phase, and stability limits shown to be dependent on S. High-speed OH-PLIF measurements show that these changes are correlated with the break-up of the shear layers into structures that lead to large-scale flame annihilation events. In isolated flames the shear layers break-up independently, but as S is reduced the shear layers combine leading to large-scale flame merging resulting in the roll up of a single large-scale vortex structure altering the flame annihilation events compared with the case of isolated flames. A flame front event tracking algorithm is developed to characterise the two-dimensional topology and identify the number and spatial location of flame front annihilation events, which shows a strong correlation between these events and the fluctuating heat release rate. Compared with stable flames for the same S, it is found that self-excited instabilities do not significantly increase the number of annihilation events but rather affects their spatial distribution and phase within the oscillation cycle.

First, different OLRs of 0.64–2.34 gCOD/L/d, by increasing the initial MEG concentrations at a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4.5 d, were examined from day 1 to 100 at lower salinity of 10 gNaCl/L and ambient temperature (25 ± 6 °C).

Afterwards, impacts of higher salinities of 15–25 gNaCl/L were investigated from day 101 to 208 at a controlled mesophilic temperature of 35 °C and fixed OLR (0.64 gCOD/L/d). As a result, enhanced HY and MY (∼2-fold) at elevated salinities up to 25 gNaCl/L were obtained. Moreover, the compartment-wise water and gas analyses, for both experiments, revealed that hydrogen and methane peaked in former and latter compartments, respectively, and the peak location shifted depending on overall imposed OLR.

While soot emissions from the diesel-CNG combustion can be tested in a real-world single-cylinder engine, the soot formation characteristics cannot be tested in the same way. Therefore, to understand the mechanisms behind soot formation in diesel-CNG combustion, soot evolution must be investigated using a simulation model. In this study, the soot evolution is investigated under different CNG substitution ratios with single and split fuel injection. An AVL 5402 single-cylinder diesel engine was modified to run diesel/CNG dual-fuel to investigate the combustion and soot emissions. A new soot model using KIVA-3V R2 code and integrated with a reduced heptane/methane PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) mechanism was used to simulate soot behavior. For the combustion, the results show that the ignition delay gets extended, the combustion duration gets shorter and the peak pressure can be improved when CNG substitution ratio is increased both with single and split injection. Additionally, a slight increase of pressure is observed when the split injection is used. This is because the split injection is an effective strategy to change the distribution and vaporization of fuel, which results in an incremental increase in combustion efficiency and increase pressure. As the CNG substitution ratio is increased, soot emissions get drastically reduced. The reason is the equivalence ratio distribution of air-fuel becomes more homogenous and the local fuel-rich region shrinks with increasing of CNG substitution ratios. Pyrene is an important intermediate specie to generate soot particles. The results show that pyrene distribution decreases, leading to a reduced generation of soot precursors. As a result, the soot mass of CNG70 is less than the other two cases. The basic reason is the prolonged ignition delay allowed for more time for fuel−air mixing, which reduces soot mass formation.\n               ", "key_words": ["Dual-fuel combustion", "KIVA-3V R2 code", "Soot model", "Single and split injection"]}

High-repetition-rate simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) were performed at three measurement planes perpendicular to the jet axis. The measurements provided qualitative as well as quantitative information on the evolution of complex flow structures and transient events such as re-ignition, local extinction and vortex-flame interactions in the turbulent reacting flow. Transverse jets composed of H2 mixed with N2 and premixed natural gas and air were injected through a tube protruding into the crossflow. The vitiated crossflow is produced by a low swirl burner (LSB). The crossflow exhibits considerable swirl at the location of the transverse jet injection. Two momentum flux ratios, J = 3 and J = 8 were employed to study the effect of momentum flux ratio on the stabilization of reaction fronts. The time-averaged flow field show a pair of steady wake vortices, which were found to be much larger for J = 8 than for the J = 3 case. The region with the maximum time-averaged OH-PLIF intensity was found to be localized between the wake vortex pairs.

Previous studies have shed light upon consumer-oriented energy consumption and carbon emission, however, the critical problem of sector-to-sector energy linkages between supply side and demand side has not been fully addressed. Besides, there also lacks sufficient research on the energy conservation potential of residents’ lifestyle change. This paper investigates the direct and indirect impact of household consumption activities on energy consumption in China from the consumers’ lifestyle perspective based on the input-output analysis. The relationship between household energy consumption and industrial energy consumption and the effect of lifestyle change on energy conservation are also considered. It is estimated that China’s energy consumption caused by household consumption activities in 2012 is 29141.97 PJ in total, which accounts for 24.7% of the total final energy consumption. The indirect energy consumption of household consumption activities is 1.35 times more than the direct energy consumption. Housing activities cause the most indirect energy consumption, and the smelting and pressing industry of ferrous metal is the most energy-consuming industrial sector influenced by household consumption. We also find that adopting low-carbon consumption pattern and accelerating the decrease of energy intensity are both effective means to reduce the total energy consumption by scenario analysis. Finally the energy conservation potential by comparing different types of household consumption behaviors is revealed to make policy makers form vivid impressions on the importance of demand side regulation.", "key_words": ["Household consumption", "Energy consumption", "Input-output analysis", "Energy conservation", "Lifestyle change"], "scp_id": "85020700494", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "60"}

However, its implementation in a given reservoir requires demonstration that CO2 leakage through the reservoir seal (caprock) is extremely limited. One possible cause of rapid leakage is capillary failure of the caprock, which is to a large extent controlled by the CO2/water interfacial tension (IFT). This paper presents pendant drop measurements of IFTs between water and CO2 in a range of temperatures (308–383K) and pressures (5–45MPa) relevant to CO2 storage in deep geological formations. Phase densities were measured simultaneously, allowing precise IFT determinations. Increasing the pressure along a given isotherm, IFTs were observed to decrease sharply, then to level off and reach, for pressures above 20MPa, a pseudo-plateau that decreases slightly with temperature, from around 30mN/m at 308K to 23 mN/m at 383K. The presence of salt (20g/l NaCl) in the water phase has a negligible effect on the IFT. An important conclusion for CO2 storage is that CO2/brine IFTs have low but reasonable values (higher than 20mN/m) even at the highest pressures and temperatures examined, and that, neglecting all other possible effects, CO2 storage can, therefore, be considered even in deep geological formations.", "key_words": ["CO2 geological storage", "Caprock integrity", "Interfacial tension"], "scp_id": "33846286125", "affil": [{"affilname": "Universite de Pau et des Pays de L'Adour", "contry": "France"}, {"affilname": "Centre Scientifique et Technique Jean Féger", "contry": "France"}], "citedby_count": "291"}

Especially in the case of turbulent combustion, appropriate reduction methods are required to save computational costs, while preserving a desired accuracy.

It is used to identify a two-dimensional manifold in the composition space, describing the thermochemical states of an unconfined, lean premixed, piloted, turbulent methane/air flame. This stratified flame is an interesting case, because it coveres different flamelet regimes, namly premixed flamelets and premixed flamelets mixing with air, which complicates the application of flamelet methods. Although the REDIM method is not restricted to a specific flamelet regime, previous works dealt either with premixed or diffusion flames. Thus in the current work, the application of the REDIM method is extended to an intermediate flamelet regime. The application of the method is demonstrated step by step, which includes the detailed description of determining an initial manifold and of estimating gradients. Eventually a two-dimensional manifold for a physically motivated gradient estimation is presented and analyzed by a comparison to detailed flamelet trajectories. The discussion shows, that the manifold accounts for important premixed and diffusion scenarios of the turbulent flame.

We found that the combustion efficiency increases as the pressure is reduced from 1.0 atm to 0.8 atm, and then decreases when the pressure is further reduced from 0.8 atm to 0.5 atm. Numerical analyses reveal that when the pressure is reduced to 0.8 atm, the laminar burning velocity, the heat release rate and the effective Lewis number are increased, while the stretch rate is decreased. The combined effects of these aspects retard the occurrence of “flame tip opening” and lead to a higher combustion efficiency. When the pressure is further reduced to 0.5 atm, the fuel supply and heat release amount are significantly reduced, resulting in much lower temperature level and weaker reaction intensity.

Still they may also give rise to strong flame dynamics and harmful combustion instabilities. In order to improve our control on such systems, multi-stage multi-injection burners offer additional degrees of freedom in the fuel distribution and thus in the combustion regime. The BIMER combustor has been expressly developed by EM2C to investigate this solution at a laboratory scale. It is composed of two swirling stages: the pilot stage, in which liquid fuel is injected through a pressure-swirl atomizer; and the multipoint stage, in which the fuel is injected through 10 holes in a jet-in-crossflow configuration. Successive experimental campaigns demonstrated the key-role played by fuel distribution in the two stages and clearly showed the existence of an hysteresis cycle: several flame stabilization archetypes can exist for the same fuel distribution, depending on the flow, spray and flame history. In-depth analysis through numerous experimental diagnostics permitted to elaborate several scenarii to explain this complex behavior.

BE usually replaces gasoline in petrol engines but it can be also blended in low concentrations to feed diesel engines. In this paper the results of an experimental activity aimed to study the impact of a BE/biodiesel/mineral diesel blend on performance and emissions in a last generation automotive diesel engine are presented. The tests were performed in steady-state in eight partial load engine conditions and at 2500rpm in full load. Two fuel blends have been compared: the Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME)/diesel with 10% of biodiesel by volume (B10), and the BE/RME/diesel with 20% of BE and 10% of biodiesel by volume (E20B10). The experimental campaign was carried out on a 2.0L diesel engine compliant with Euro5 regulation. The engine features the closed loop combustion control (CLCC), which enables individual and real-time control of injection phasing and cylinder inner torque by means of in-cylinder pressure sensors connected with the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). As expected, the results showed a strong smoke emissions reduction for E20B10 in all tested conditions, mainly due to the high oxygen content of BE. Also a reduction of NOx emissions were observed with BE addiction. The results confirm that the CLCC adoption enables a significant improvement in the robustness of the engine performance and emissions when blends with low heat content and very low cetane number (as BE blends) are burnt. Nevertheless, high CO and HCs emissions for BE blends still remain a critical issue, even with the CLCC technology.", "key_words": ["Ethanol–diesel blends", "Ethanol diesel combustion", "Diesel engine emissions", "Closed loop diesel combustion control", "Alternative automotive fuels"], "scp_id": "84870731211"}

Thus, not only the total mass of soot released from hydrocarbon combustion have to be controlled but also its particle size distribution. Combustion technologies such as oxygen-enriched and oxy-fuel allied with flue gas recirculation have demonstrated their potential for reducing pollutants while improving combustion efficiency. In this context, this work explores the effect of CO2 addition on the soot formation process under an oxygen enriched atmosphere. A set of laminar counterflow ethylene flames are numerically studied for CO2 addition on either the fuel or the oxidizer mixtures for the same CO2 amount in the reaction layer. The numerical approach accounts for detailed chemistry and transport properties, together with an advanced model for thermal radiation and the discrete sectional model for soot formation. It was observed that CO2 suppresses the formation of species such as hydrocarbon radicals (C2H, C3H3), C2H2 and A1, which are important PAHs building block species directly involved in the soot formation process. For the same amount of CO2 in the reaction layer, it was found a more expressive suppression of the aforementioned species concentrations when CO2 was added to the fuel mixture. Moreover, for the same amount of CO2 in the reaction layer, it was also found that while chemical effects played a major role on the formation of C2H2, C3H3 and PAHs for the CO2 addition on the oxidizer side, both chemical and thermophysical effects are important for CO2 addition on the fuel side. In both cases, the temperature profile was mainly influenced by thermophysical effects while the soot volume fraction was mainly influenced by chemical effects. Finally, the particle-size distribution reveled to be strongly bimodal and slightly sensitive on the CO2 addition for the current flames.", "key_words": ["Soot sectional method", "Laminar counterflow flame", "CO2 addition", "Particle size distribution", "WSGG radiation model"], "affil": null, "citedby_count": "14"}

The reduction is obtained by assuming fast reaction groups of the reaction system to be in steady state. We developed a method to apply the reduced schemes to adiabatic flat flames. The results are compared with those of detailed chemistry calculations. The accuracy of the results of reduction of the most simple reaction system, (which does not include the species HO2 and H2O2) is quite well. The other reaction systems, however, give appreciable errors in burning velocity. This is mainly caused by large deviations in HO2 mole fractions between reduced and full scheme calculations, while the reaction rate and the burning velocity are sensitive to variations in the mole fraction of HO2. Considering the time scales of the reaction system and the time scales of convection and diffusion it is shown that at low temperatures, where the mole fraction of HO2 reaches its maximum, the basic assumptions applied to reduce the mechanisms are not justified. It is concluded that the hydrogen/air system can only be reduced to an accurate one-step reduced scheme, if reaction schemes without HO2 and H2O2 are used.

Key processes are heat and mass transfer between the gas and particle surface and diffusion of mass and energy inside the particle. The second stage begins upon melting of the aluminum core. Melting results in pressure buildup, thereby facilitating mass diffusion and/or cracking of the oxide layer. Melting is followed by polymorphic phase transformations, which also results in the formation of openings in the oxide layer. These provide pathways for the molten aluminum to react with the oxidizing gas; the ensuing energy release results in ignition of nano-aluminum particles.

The catalytic membrane reactor (CMR), combining a WGS catalyst and hydrogen-selective metal membrane, can potentially replace the multiple shift and separation stages of a plant based on conventional technology. CMR-based shift and separation offers several major advantages over the conventional approach, including greater-than-equilibrium WGS conversion, the containment of the CO2 at high-pressure and a reduction in the number of unit processes.\n                  To determine capital costs of a WGS CMR-based H2-from-coal plant, a prototype planar CMR was constructed and tested with varying catalyst bed depth, residence time and membrane type (commercially-sourced 50 μm Pd or 40 μm Pd-25Ag wt%). Experiments to measure CO conversion, and H2 flux and yield were conducted at 400 °C with a feed pressure of 20 bar H2O:C ratio of 3 and a H2 product pressure of 1 bar.\n                  Under the optimum conditions examined (with a 40 μm-thick Pd-25Ag membrane and <3 mm-thick catalyst bed), a membrane surface area of ∼25,000 m2 would be required to provide a throughput of 300 tpd with 85% H2 yield. The capital cost of the CMR component of the plant would be around $US 180 million (based on current metal prices), of which 73% can be attributed to the cost of the Pd–Ag alloy membranes. Incorporation of a membrane that meets the 2015 US DOE cost and flux targets would offer cost parity, with a plant cost of $US 44 million and a total membrane area of ∼13,000 m2. Meeting these performance and cost targets would likely require a shift to very thin Pd-alloy membranes or highly-permeable Group IV, V body-centred-cubic alloys.\n               ", "key_words": ["Coal", "Hydrogen", "Water-gas-shift", "Membrane", "Palladium", "Membrane reactor"], "affil": [{"affilname": "CSIRO Energy Technology", "contry": "Australia"}, {"affilname": "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization", "contry": "Australia"}], "citedby_count": "56"}

The optimal values of nine important design parameters, the annual energy yield, and the levelized cost of electricity are calculated for 50 Baseline Surface Radiation Network stations by an automatic photovoltaic optimization method based on datasets with six different resolutions created by two aggregation methods. The aggregation by averaging suppresses the high irradiance values resulting from the transient cloud enhancement effect, while the aggregation by sampling a single value from the middle of each aggregation interval can retain the original distribution of minute-resolution data.

It is founded on the fact that composite propellant combustion is largely boxed between the premixed limits – of pure AP and fine AP-binder (HTPB, here) whose burn behaviors are taken as known. The current strategy accounts for particle size distribution using the burn time averaging approach. The diffusional effects are accounted for through a calibrated heterogeneous quasi-one-dimensional model (HeQu1-D for short) that allows for the flame temperature dependence on the local AP size-binder thickness geometry. Fine AP-binder homogenization is adopted as in recent models with refinement on the particle size as a function of pressure. The specialty of the present approach is that it invokes local extinction for fuel rich conditions for specific particle sizes when the heat balance causes the surface temperature to drop below the low pressure deflagration limit of AP; this feature allows for the prediction of extinction of propellant combustion. Combining these ideas into a MATLAB® calculation framework that uses a single dataset on properties of AP and binder consistent with burn rate vs. pressure of pure AP and fine AP-binder system allows for making the predictions of propellants with multiple particle sizes and different fractions. Comparisons of burn rate data over nearly thirty compositions from different sources appear excellent to good. It is found that it is important to treat the full particle size distribution to achieve better predictions. Low burn rate index (∼0.25) observed with addition of SrCO3 is captured by extending the model to include the effect of binder melt; the gas phase effect is accounted for by calibration against catalytic effect on the fine AP-binder propellant. An interesting deduction from the model is that the temperature sensitivity of propellants should not exceed that of AP. The robustness of the current model and speed of determining the burn rate behavior allow for the possibility of determining the particle size distribution required to meet the burn rate specifications of a specific propellant for practical applications before actually embarking on making the propellant.", "key_words": ["AP/HTPB composite propellants", "Heterogeneity", "Serial burning", "Extinction", "Modeling"], "affil": [{"affilname": "Indian Institute of Technology Madras", "contry": "India"}, {"affilname": "Indian Institute of Science", "contry": "India"}], "citedby_count": "7"}

Effects of operating conditions, including methanol to oil ratio, temperature, and reaction time on biodiesel production yield were investigated. The optimum biodiesel yield was 88.2%, obtained at 0.4:1 methanol to oil mass ratio at 40°C for 90min. This yield corresponded to 155g biodiesel per kg castor plant.

Its accuracy depends on both the adequacy of the fitting function and the quality of the fitted wind speed data. Therefore, the system of wind speed distributions was recently introduced to further improve the statistical estimation of wind turbine energy yield. The system of wind speed distributions incorporates the three complement distributions Kappa, Wakeby and Burr-Generalized Extreme Value. In contrast to the progress that has been made in the statistical description of wind speed distributions, there is little research on the effects of poor quality data on the estimation of wind turbine energy yield. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the robustness of the system of wind speed distributions against typical wind speed data shortcomings such as (1) measurement errors, (2) missing data, and (3) low temporal resolution. The database were quality-controlled wind speed time series from 187 measurement stations of the German Meteorological Service located in Germany with a 10-minute temporal resolution. The investigated time series cover the period from July 2016 to December 2017. The original wind speed time series were modified by (1) rounding them to 0.5 m/s and 1 m/s steps, (2) reducing data availability to 1.0% and 0.5%, (3) reducing the temporal resolution. Afterwards, the original and the modified wind speed time series were fitted to the system of wind speed distributions. Ten goodness-of-fit metrics were applied for comparison of the original wind speed distributions with the modified distributions fitted to the system of wind speed distributions. Overall, it was found that the system of wind speed distributions is robust against common quality issues in the wind speed time series. Applying a 2.5 MW wind turbine power curve and fitting the system of wind speed distributions to integer wind speed data, the mean percentage annual energy yield error was estimated at 3.3%. Fitting the system of wind speed distributions to wind speed data with very low data availability of 0.5% of the original data, the annual energy yield over all stations was underestimated at −8.2%.

A surrogate model is developed based on Latin hypercube design of experiment and response surface methodology that relates the rate of hydrogen production in the catalyst coating microstructure to inter-particle porosity and average particle size. Two sets of simulations are done based on a kinetic model with two different sets of kinetic parameters and the results are compared.

Assessments of climate change mitigation potential of new technologies often pay less attention to the criticality of the enabling minerals. We assessed the effects of adopting 4 hybrid architectures on the life-cycle GHG emissions of an emerging fuel and powertrain solution: the use of a novel high-reactivity fuel in an advanced compression-ignition engine (GCI). The 4 hybrids were contrasted against conventional fuels/engines, and a comparable battery electric vehicle using regionally-explicit power mixes in the 3 biggest automotive markets worldwide (China, USA and Europe). The use of larger batteries enabled higher degrees of electrification and it could lead to lower overall emissions. However, there is diminishing returns for every kWh of increasing battery size: a mild hybrid resulted in more than 50% GHG reduction per kWh of battery, whereas an electric vehicle only reduced emission by 4% per kWh given its much larger battery requirement. Given the sustainability constraints of critical raw minerals supply, and the heterogeneity of regional power grids, advanced GCI hybrid architectures, with varying degrees of electrification, can bridge the gap in the interim.\n               ", "key_words": ["Life-cycle assessment", "Gasoline compression ignition", "Electric vehicle", "Critical metals"], "scp_id": "85083005059", "affil": [{"affilname": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "contry": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"affilname": "Saudi Arabian Oil Company", "contry": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"affilname": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "contry": "China"}, {"affilname": "Aramco Overseas Company B.V.

Analysis of the heat release and temperature in the different equivalence ratio (φ) regions reveals that sequential auto-ignition of the stratified charge occurs in order of increasing φ for 1bar intake pressure but in order of decreasing φ for 2bar intake pressure. Increased low- and intermediate-temperature heat release at 2bar intake pressure compensates for decreased temperatures in higher-φ regions due to evaporative cooling from the liquid fuel spray and decreased compression heating from lower values of the ratio of specific heats. At 1bar intake pressure, the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites before the highest-φ regions and the sequential auto-ignition occurs too fast for useful reduction of the maximum pressure rise rate compared to HCCI. Conversely, at 2bar intake pressure, the premixed portion of the charge auto-ignites last, after the higher-φ regions.

It is currently not possible to evaluate the energy saving potential of innovative adaptive transparent building envelopes in an accurate manner. This creates difficulties in selecting between competing technologies and is a barrier to systematic development of these innovative technologies. The main aim of this work is to develop a method for devising optimal adaptive glazing properties and to evaluate the energy saving potential resulting from the adoption of such a technology. The method makes use of an inverse performance-oriented approach, to minimize the total primary energy use of a building. It is applied to multiple case studies (office reference room with 4 different cardinal orientations and in three different temperate climates) in order to evaluate and optimise the performance of adaptive glazing as it responds to changing boundary conditions on a monthly and daily basis. A frequency analysis on the set of optimised adaptive properties is subsequently performed to identify salient features of ideal adaptive glazing. The results show that high energy savings are achievable by adapting the transparent part of the building envelope alone, the largest component being the cooling energy demand. As expected, the energy savings are highly sensitive to: the time scale of the adaptive mechanisms; the capability of the façade to adapt to the outdoor climatic condition; the difference between outdoor climatic condition and the comfort range. Moreover important features of the optimal thermo-optical properties are identified. Of these, one of the most important findings is that a unique optimised technology, varying its thermo-optical properties between a limited number of states could be effective in different climates and orientations.", "key_words": ["Smart glazing", "Responsive building elements", "High performance facades", "Optimisation", "Receding horizon control"], "scp_id": "84936094030"}

Numerical results confirm previous findings that the cooling performance of the natural draft dry cooling tower degrades with the increment of wind velocity when wind velocity is higher than 4m/s, but the performance reduction is relatively less. The circumferential non-uniform ventilation and the vortices inside the tower contribute the most to the degrading of the cooling performance when crosswind is present.

Flow and flame spread in the mixing chamber were mapped using high-speed shadowgraphy, extensive laser Doppler velocimetry, and radical imaging. Flow visualization and velocity measurements showed that a fuel jet followed by an air jet enter the pulse combustor as soon as the combustor pressure drops below the reactants' supply pressures. If most of the heat were released at that time, the heat release and pressure fluctuations would be out of phase, which, according to Rayleigh's criterion, would prevent pulse combustion operation. In practice, pulse combustion operation is attained through the interaction of several processes. First, the fuel jet is ignited as soon as it enters the mixing chamber, generating pockets of burning gas. This reacting flow is entrained and convected by the air jet, which follows the fuel jet into the combustor, first downstream and then upstream in the mixing chamber. Simultaneously, fuel and air continue to enter the combustor, but are not immediately ignited, either because of excessive flame stretch caused by the fast moving fuel and air jets or because the air stream has displaced any hot gases that could act as ignition sources. Once the reacting gas pockets return to the upstream half of the mixing chamber, they ignite the combustible mixture that has collected there. This causes a rapid increase in heat release rate, which leads the pressure oscillation by around 30°. This investigation showed that the interaction between complex flow and combustion process within the mixing chamber causes the time delay needed to produce heat release oscillations that are nearly in phase with the pressure oscillations, thus assuring pulse combustion operation.\n               ", "key_words": null, "scp_id": "0028982815", "affil": [{"affilname": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "Tamkang University", "contry": "Taiwan"}], "citedby_count": "51"}

For this reason, aerodynamic models of the full geometry of wind turbines are needed to gain insight to improve turbine designs. In this work, the unsteady flow around an experimental horizontal-axis wind turbine is studied using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The emphasis is put on the effects of the nacelle, tower and rotation of the blades on the induction region and near-wake. The simulations are performed using unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations in conjunction with the shear-stress transport k- ω model. The sliding mesh method is employed to enable the rotation of the blades. The simulations were performed at the design tip speed ratio ( λ = 6.67 ) and two off-design conditions ( λ = 4.17 and 10) to assess the general validity of the numerical model. The obtained results of global loads, force distribution on the blades and tower, velocity components and angle of attack are presented in detail. It is found that the tower has little effect on the rotor loads (circular pattern), but the blades have an important effect on the tower (three-leaved rose pattern). The force distribution reveals only significant fluctuations on the blades ( r / R < 0.75 ) at λ = 4.17, whereas the tower is affected in the zone exposed to the wake behind the rotor for all three wind speeds. Furthermore, the interaction between blades is evaluated in terms of velocity and angle of attack. The correspondence between the results for different rotor blade positions reveals the effect of the ground on the rotor is negligible.

Combustion modeling strategies based on single flame archetype fail to predict pollutant species, such as CO. To account for multiple combustion regimes, at a reduced computational cost, a novel approach based on virtual optimized mechanisms is developed. This method consists in (i) building a kinetic scheme from scratch instead of reducing a detailed mechanism, (ii) using a reduced number of virtual reactions and virtual species that do not represent real entities and (iii) using sub-mechanisms dedicated to the prediction of given flame quantities. In the present work, kinetic rate parameters of the virtual reactions and virtual species thermodynamic properties are optimized through a genetic algorithm to properly capture the flame temperature as well as CO formation in hydrocarbon/air flames. The virtual optimized chemistry approach is first applied to the derivation of methane/air reduced kinetic schemes. The flame solutions obtained with the virtual optimized mechanisms are subsequently compared to the reference flame library showing good predictive capabilities for both premixed and non-premixed flame archetypes. Analysis of the impact of the reference database demonstrated that the quality of CO formation modeling depends on the reference flame library used to train the optimized kinetic scheme. The virtual mechanisms are also tested on 2-D partially-premixed burners showing good agreement between the reference mechanism and the reduced virtual schemes.

The emission inventories provide robust, self-consistent, transparent and comparable data support for identifying spatial–temporal emission characteristics, developing low-carbon policies, monitoring mitigation progress in GBA cities as well as further emissions-related studies at a city-level. The low-carbon roadmaps designed for GBA cities and their surroundings also provide a benchmark for other developing countries/cities to adapting changing climate and achieve sustainable development.", "key_words": ["Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area", "Belt and Road Initiative", "CO2 emissions", "Low-carbon development pathways", "Urban agglomeration"], "scp_id": "85049906145"}

A novel communication efficient algorithm, called Energy Trading Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ETD-ADMM), is proposed to solve the social welfare maximization problem in a decentralized manner without requiring any central authority. The algorithm is formulated using the concept of node coloring, where each node only needs to negotiate with its neighbors to reach the global optimal solution. The decrease in communications makes the trading scheme more privacy-preserving and scalable than other contemporary approaches.

In this study, an overview is given of existing correlations of the exterior convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) with the wind speed, indicating significant differences between these correlations. As an alternative to using existing correlations, the applicability of CFD to obtain forced CHTC correlations is evaluated, by considering a cubic building in an atmospheric boundary layer. Steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are performed and, instead of the commonly used wall functions, low-Reynolds number modelling (LRNM) is used to model the boundary-layer region for reasons of improved accuracy. The flow field is found to become quasi independent of the Reynolds number at Reynolds numbers of about 105. This allows limiting the wind speed at which the CHTC is evaluated and thus the grid resolution in the near-wall region, which significantly reduces the computational expense. The distribution of the power-law CHTC-U 10 correlation over the windward and leeward surfaces is presented (U 10 =reference wind speed at 10m height).

The research results show that the order of the effective heat transfer improvement of four wind-break structures is the wind-break, cross wall, line-screen and louvers. The wind-break wall is the most optimal structure, but its performance is strictly influenced by the direction and velocity of the wind, and the cross walls and cross line-screen structure have similar limitation in the practice operation. The louver is installed in each sector, and it is the next best option for increasing the heat transfer performance. It can be flexibly adjusted based on the wind direction and velocity. With the decrease in the louver opening, k, there is a decrease in the heat transfer rate of the windward sectors, and a significant increase in the heat transfer rate of the leeward sectors. Thus the total heat transfer rate of the IDAC tower can be improved tremendously.

This procedure enables coupling of detailed solvent properties, such as reaction enthalpy, VLE, and kinetics, with the overall process operation, while accounting for the magnitude of the energy sinks in the process. The method identifies areas where there may be room for potential improvement, shows how the fundamental chemical properties of the solvents give rise to the overall capture potential, and highlights interdependencies between major energy sinks in the process. This framework is then used to clarify where heat is spent in the process for two novel solvent systems: activated 2-Piperidineethanol (2-PPE) and 1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidine (1-(2HE)PRLD). These novel solvents are compared with a base case of MEA and Cesar1. Activated 2-Piperidineethanol showed the best performance for the process setup evaluated in this work. The regenerative efficiency parameter for this solvent is 66% with an optimum specific reboiler duty of 2.78 MJ/kg CO2 removed; a 22% reduction compared to MEA in the coal case. Furthermore, the solvent seems to be sufficiently fast to be used in an industrial absorber and is a promising system for post combustion CO2 capture. This results in a power plant specific energy penalty for avoided CO2 of 0.27 kWhel/kg CO2.

A key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC for complex systems such as buildings is related to the difficulties (cost, time and effort) associated with the identification of a predictive model of a building. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel idea for predictive control based on historical building data leveraging machine learning algorithms like regression trees and random forests. We call this approach Data-driven model Predictive Control (DPC), and we apply it to three different case studies to demonstrate its performance, scalability and robustness. In the first case study we consider a benchmark MPC controller using a bilinear building model, then we apply DPC to a data-set simulated from such bilinear model and derive a controller based only on the data. Our results demonstrate that DPC can provide comparable performance with respect to MPC applied to a perfectly known mathematical model. In the second case study we apply DPC to a 6 story 22 zone building model in EnergyPlus, for which model-based control is not economical and practical due to extreme complexity, and address a Demand Response problem. Our results demonstrate scalability and efficiency of DPC showing that DPC provides the desired power curtailment with an average error of 3%. In the third case study we implement and test DPC on real data from an off-grid house located in L’Aquila, Italy. We compare the total amount of energy saved with respect to the classical bang-bang controller, showing that we can perform an energy saving up to 49.2%. Our results demonstrate robustness of our method to uncertainties both in real data acquisition and weather forecast.", "key_words": ["Building control", "Energy optimization", "Demand response", "Machine learning", "Random forests", "Receding horizon control"], "scp_id": "85045938289"}

In order to rigorously validate turbulent combustion simulations against experimental data, this uncertainty must be separated from deficiencies in the turbulent combustion model itself. In this work, a method is developed for quantifying the uncertainty in turbulent flame simulations due to input uncertainty in the chemical mechanism. Here the method is developed for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) combined with a steady flamelet model. Rather than a brute force probabilistic approach in which hundreds or thousands of LES runs are required to compute statistics of outputs of interest, the method takes advantage of the actual algorithm employed with the steady flamelet model. First, the high-dimensional uncertainty in the chemical kinetics is propagated through the flamelet equations, and the resulting lower-dimensional joint distribution of the temperature, species mass fractions, and other derived quantities is used as a stochastic equation of state in the LES. Since only a few “active” quantities are needed to evolve the LES governing equations, efficient non-intrusive stochastic collocation is used to propagate the uncertainty in the density, requiring only a few LES runs. This process captures the uncertainty in the flow field induced by the uncertainty in the chemical kinetic rates. The remaining uncertainty in “passive” quantities, that is, quantities needed only for post-processing such as the temperature and species mass fractions, is computed with random sampling during the LES runs. The uncertainty quantification algorithm is demonstrated with Sandia flame D, and it is shown that the uncertainty in the simulation results caused by uncertainties in the kinetic rates is sufficiently large to account for the discrepancies with the experimental measurements. The implication is that the turbulent combustion model cannot be fairly assessed with such a large uncertainty.", "key_words": ["Uncertainty quantification", "Turbulent nonpremixed flames", "Large Eddy Simulation", "Sandia flame D"], "scp_id": "84874693948", "affil": [{"affilname": "Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen", "contry": "Germany"}, {"affilname": "Stanford University", "contry": "United States"}], "citedby_count": "32"}

This study presents and demonstrates an experimentally validated simulation-based technology for rapidly and accurately estimating wind turbine energy yield losses due to general leading edge erosion. The technology combines the predictive accuracy of two- and three-dimensional Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics with the runtime reductions enabled by artificial neural networks and wind turbine engineering codes using the blade element momentum theory. The main demonstration is based on the assessment of the annual energy yield of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW reference turbine affected by leading edge erosion damage of increasing severity, considering damages based on available laser scans and previous leading edge erosion analysis. Results also include sensitivity studies of the energy loss to the wind characteristics of the installation site. It is found that the annual energy loss varies between about 0.3 and 4%, depending on the damage severity and the site wind characteristics. The study also illustrates the necessity of resolving the geometry of eroded leading edges rather than accounting for the effects of erosion with surrogate models, since, after an initial increase of distributed surface roughness, erosion yields leading edge geometry alterations causing aerodynamic losses exceeding those due to the loss of boundary layer laminarity consequent to roughness-induced transition.

Some metallic coatings (Ni, Co, and Cu) may significantly reduce the Cr release from interconnects and slow down the oxide scale growth on the steel substrate. To shed additional light upon the mechanisms of such protection and find a suitable coating material for ferritic stainless steel materials widely used for interconnects, we used a combination of first-principles calculations, thermodynamics, and diffusion modeling to investigate which factors determine the quality of the Ni metallic coatings. We found that Cr migration in Ni coatings is determined by a delicate combination of the nickel oxidation, Cr diffusion, and phase transformation processes. Although the formation of Cr2O3 is more exothermic than that of NiO, the kinetic rate of the chromia formation in the coating layer and its surface is significantly reduced by the low mobility of Cr in nickel oxide and in NiCr2O4 spinel. These results are in a good agreement with diffusion modeling for Cr diffusion through the Ni coating layer on the ferritic 441 steel substrate and available experimental data.\n               ", "key_words": ["SOEC", "Interconnects", "Cr vaporization", "Coating", "Ferritic steel 441"]}

Based on this feature, a novel process of looping combustion of carbons (CarboLoop) has been recently proposed, and a proof-of-concept given. The process is based on alternated oxygen chemisorption on carbon and desorption of surface oxides carried out in dual bed reactors. One of the reactors, operated with an air feeding, acts as the fuel oxidizer. The second reactor, operated with partly recycled gaseous effluents (CO2 +impurities), acts as the fuel desorber. Further development of the CarboLoop concept requires the knowledge of the thermochemistry associated with the individual steps of carbon oxidation and of surface oxide desorption, which dictates the energy integration between the reactors. The present study moves along this path and provides a separate assessment of the thermochemistry of carbon oxidation and desorption stages. The procedure is based on complementary thermoanalytical techniques (TG, DSC, TPD) as well as on calorimetry. Experimental results obtained with a bituminous coal char indicate that both oxygen uptake (ΔH ≅−4kJ/gc) and desorption (ΔH ≅−31kJ/gc) are exothermic.

The response of the magnetic nanoparticles to the magnetic field generates heat inside the droplet, due to magneto relaxation, which acts as a heat source. This phenomenon is produced by friction (viscous dissipation) between rotating nanoparticles and the liquid surrounding them. The rotating motion of the nanoparticles is induced by the magnetic dipole fixed on each nanoparticle, which tends to align itself with the magnetic field. In the absence of magnetic field, Brownian motion of the liquid molecules is responsible for misaligning the dipoles, after collisions with the nanoparticle surface. Under the influence of an external alternating magnetic field, the process of aligning and misaligning repeats itself in each cycle, producing heat by viscous dissipation, due to a periodically reversing nanoparticle circular motion. Magneto relaxation heating, together with heat transfer from the flame, contribute to droplet heating, hence increasing the vaporization rate of ferrofluid droplets. The current analysis considers a magnetic heat source that is much larger than that provided by heat transfer from the flame. Under this condition, as in the case of semi-transparent droplets absorbing heat from the flame by radiation, a thermal boundary layer is formed in the liquid on the droplet surface. Additionally, under certain conditions the temperature inside the thermal boundary layer can become higher than the temperature at the droplet surface. This leads to boiling occurs inside the droplet rather than at the surface, as in classical models. The temperature difference between the thermal boundary layer and the droplet surface results in an extra heat flux to the droplet surface, which increases the vaporization rate.\n               ", "key_words": ["Ferrofluid", "Magneto relaxation heating", "Magnetic nanoparticle", "Droplet combustion"], "scp_id": "84878493468"}

This study used an improved STIRPAT model to reassess the impact of demographic and income changes on China’s energy-related CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels using balanced provincial panel data from the 1990–2012 period. Whereas most previous studies of emission–population/income elasticity in China have yielded wide-ranging estimates, this study showed that income rather than demographic change has been the dominant driving force behind China’s growing CO2 emissions. Urbanisation has increased energy consumption and emissions, except in western China. Changes in the age structure have had a statistically insignificant effect on energy use, but resulted in increased national emissions – particularly in eastern China. Shrinking household size did not reduce energy use and emissions, indicating that improved residential energy efficiency might reduce emissions.

Nevertheless, there are rare compellent evidences to clearly clarify the relationship between pore size and hydrogen storage performance in porous materials. The main reason could be ascribed to the lack of appropriate porous model structures. Herein, we propose an interesting and convincing insight into the aforementioned important issue by designing proper well-defined three types of porous carbon materials with different pore size distributions. Except for the pore size distribution, these porous carbons are derived from the same source (i.e., chitosan), and have very similar surface area of ca. 3300 m2 g−1, grain morphology and carbon microcrystalline framework structure. With these features, the obtained carbon materials can be adopted as appropriate objects to evaluate the correlation of the pore size with the hydrogen storage performance. It is demonstrated that the presence of nanopore with size from 1.5 to 2.5 nm can significantly improve high-pressure hydrogen storage capacity. Moreover, nanopores with size below 1.5 nm are indeed the most efficient hydrogen storage spaces no matter at low pressures or high pressures, whereas those mesopores with size above 2.5 nm are believed to not participate in the hydrogen storage. These results convincingly indicate that there indeed exists a strong contribution of the pore size to high hydrogen storage capacity.\n               ", "key_words": ["Porous carbon", "Pore size", "Hydrogen storage"]}

The presented approach is applied to evaluate the effectiveness of five operation strategies namely two basic, two common hybrid and the proposed hybrid strategy under three single optimization criteria for the total annual cost (TAC), primary energy consumption (PEC) and greenhouse gas generation (GHG) as well as one integrated criterion based on Utopia tracking method for the combination of these criteria.

There are various advantages of this method such as inherent carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, minimal NOx emissions and the H2 production. In this process, there is no direct contact between the fuel and oxidizer. This method utilizes oxygen from an oxygen carrier which may be a transition metal. The idea is to split the combustion process into three separate sub-processes by employing three separate reactors: air reactor where the oxygen carrier is oxidized by air, fuel reactor where natural gas is oxidized to produce a stream of CO2 and H2O and steam reactor where the steam is reduced to produce H2. In this study, a thermodynamic model with iron oxides as oxygen carrier has been developed using Aspen Plus by employing conservation of mass and energy for all the components of the CLR system. The developed model was employed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters such as mass flow rates of air, fuel, steam and oxygen carrier and fraction of inert material on H2 and CO2 production and key reactor temperatures. The results show that the H2 production increases with the increase in air, fuel and steam flow rates up to a certain limit and stays constant for higher flow rates. The CO2 production follows a similar trend. Similarly, the H2 production also increases with the increase in oxide flow rate and fraction of inert material up to a particular value, but then decrease for higher oxide flow rates and inert fractions. Reactor temperatures were also observed in this study. The temperatures increase with the increase of steam and air flow rates till the stoichiometric values and decrease thereafter. Increase in the fuel flow rate shows a decreasing trend in all the reactor temperatures. The reactor temperatures increase with the increase in oxide flow rates and the decrease of the inert mass fraction.

The structure and properties of prepared composites were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, DSC and TG. There was a good physicochemical compatibility among the components of the PA/OBC/EG composites. Two well-distinguished melting points could be observed and the obtained composites presented a good thermal stability during the working temperature range. Further, the composites also demonstrated excellent form-stable property according to the leakage test. There was no obvious PA leakage when the mass fraction of OBC in PA/OBC blends was 20% and EG had a positive effect on the leakage rate. Simultaneously, the good softness and flexibility achieved by triggering the phase transition of PA could lead to many deformation modes such as bend and compression, which were beneficial for thermal contact resistance decrease and installation improvement. Finally, the heat transfer characteristics were investigated experimentally. The heating and cooling processes were mainly affected by three factors, namely, thermal conduction, natural convection and absorption of latent heat. With EG impregnated in the composites, the heating and cooling rate could be amplified and thus improved the overall thermal performance. The results presented in this work indicate that the prepared composite PCM possesses a potential application for thermal energy storage and thermal management.", "key_words": ["Phase change material", "Olefin block copolymer", "Shape stability", "Thermal induced flexibility", "Heat transfer"], "scp_id": "85057164854"}

Two kinetic models are employed for the prediction of gas recovery and hydrate dissociation in frozen sandy sediments. The modified new model which takes into account the protection effect of ice is found to predict more accurately than the traditional one. When the deposit is situated under frozen state, the hydrate particles can be maintained at a relatively stable state even when the external pressure has dropped below the equilibrium level. Such self-preservation effect is the main factor resulting in the undesirable recovery efficiency of frozen gas hydrate by pure depressurization, and it can be only eliminated by external heat injection.

At lower PV penetration levels, it is likely that the energy mix could under-supply utility demand, thus requiring extra units of generators, while at higher penetration levels it may oversupply demands, thus wasting generator capacity. Thus, determining the optimum installed capacity, technical limits, and economic benefits of large-scale PV systems are the main issues for both power utilities and decision makers. This study describes the development and validation of an alternative method (called the generation-demand matching model, GDMM) for evaluating the large-scale implementation of grid-connected PV power plants in Peninsular Malaysia relative to its interface with the traditional power grid system. The method explicitly provides a detailed assessment of the temporal and spatial factors that facilitate the match between PV generated electricity and electricity demand. These evaluation factors are analyzed using simulations of PV performance located at optimal sites. Optimal sites along with physical constraints were mapped using geographic information systems (GIS) for visualization and representation by location. PV electricity generation at different levels of penetration was predicted hourly for a year using time series analysis. This allowed comparison of electricity generation with electricity demand to evaluate the impacts of increasing levels of PV penetration. A novel feature of the proposed method is its combination of topographical and topological map data with metric data.

Few researches tried to analyze the mechanism by comparison of flame development patterns and flame speed under different stratified conditions. In this work, high-speed imaging of natural flame luminosity was used to study the combustion process from homogeneous charge to stratified charge with a higher frame rate. Different stratification conditions were formed by adjusting the injection timings. Results show that the proportion of flame propagation increases and combustion reaction rate decreases as fuel distribution in cylinder changes from homogeneous charge to stratified charge. Flame propagation of auto-ignition kernel exists although the combustion is dominated by multipoint auto-ignition in HCCI combustion. The flame spreading speed is much higher than the flame speed because the fictitious reaction front is shorter than the actual reaction front for flame spreading speed calculation. Four principles are proposed for equivalent radius method to get more reasonable results of flame speed. For conditions that do not satisfy these principles, effective front method can be used. Flame speed in CI combustion modes is in the range of 10–50 m/s depending on different stratification conditions in current study. There is a good correlation between the flame speed and the peak heat release rate as SOI is retarded, i.e., high flame speed corresponds to high peak heat release rate. It can be concluded that controlling fuel stratification is an effective method to regulate the ratio between auto-ignition and flame propagation and achieve effective control on combustion reaction rate.", "key_words": ["Flame development pattern", "Flame speed", "Homogeneous charge", "Stratified charge", "High-speed imaging"], "affil": null, "citedby_count": "21"}

SOEC and SOFC systems are now well-optimised as individual systems; this work studies the effect of using the bi-directionality of the SOC at a system level. Since the system performance is highly dependent on the cell-stack operating conditions, this study improves the stack parameters for both operation modes. Moreover, the year-round cumulative exergy method (CE) is introduced in the solid oxide cell (SOC) context for estimating the system exergy efficiencies. This method is an attempt to obtain more insightful exergy assessments since it takes into account the operational hours of the SOC system in both modes. The CE method therefore helps to predict more accurately the most efficient configuration and operating parameters based on the power production and consumption curves in a year. Variation of operating conditions, configurations and SOC parameters show a variation of Bi-SOC system year-round cumulative exergy efficiency from 33% to 73%.

Identification and quantification of the intermediates were achieved by synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry in a flow reactor and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and gas chromatography in a JSR. A pyrolysis model of butane-2,3‑dione, incorporating the sub-mechanisms of butane-2,3‑dione, ketene, C1–C4 hydrocarbons and the formation of benzene, was developed from our recently reported C1 model in this work. It was validated against the present pyrolysis data of butane-2,3‑dione and the pyrolysis data of C2–C4 hydrocarbon fuels and ketene in the literature. Generally, the present model could reasonably predict all the experimental targets. Based on the rate of production analysis, the unimolecular decomposition reaction (CH3COCOCH3 (+ M) = 2CH3CO (+ M)) is the dominant pathway to consume the fuel at low pressure. However, at atmospheric and high pressures, both the unimolecular decomposition reaction and the H abstraction reaction of butane-2,3‑dione by methyl radical are important. Ketene, acetone and acetaldehyde were measured in this work and their formation is also pressure dependent.

Their contribution becomes less at atmospheric pressure and can be neglected at high pressure. In contrast, the combination reactions are responsible for methyl-related growth at high pressure.

Under hydrothermal conditions, the reduction of H2PtCl6 and graphene oxide (GO), the oxidation of SnCl2 and the formation of SnO2 were occurred synchronously without additional reducing or oxidizing agent. The introduction of EDTA results in good dispersion and full integration of Pt and SnO2 nanoparticles, due to the complexation between Pt4+ (Sn2+) and EDTA.

A micro-gas turbine with 100kW electric-output is chosen as an example to study the effects of temperature difference and pressure loss in the gas-to-air heat exchanger on cycle efficiency and power.

A great deal of research has been conducted within the smart grid system community in developing an assortment of different algorithms that seek to increase the accuracy of these predictions. However, these predictions suffer from various sources of error, such as the variations in weather conditions, calendar effects, economic indicators, and many other sources, which are caused by the inherent stochastic and nonlinear characteristics of power demand. In order to quantify the uncertainty in load forecasting effectively, this paper proposes a comprehensive probability density forecasting method employing Gaussian process quantile regression (GPQR). GPQR is a type of Bayesian non-parametric method which can handle the uncertainties in power load data in a principled manner. Consequently, the probabilistic distribution of power load data can be statistically formulated. The effectiveness of the proposed method for short-term load forecasting has been assessed adopting the real dataset provided by American PJM electric power company. Numerical results demonstrate that the uncertainties in power load data can be effectively acquired based on the proposed method.

However, for the present equivalence ratio, the firing rate at flashback is approximately five times higher than typical estimates given in Ref. 8.

The behavior of OWTs with the hybrid monopile foundation in service conditions are investigated under lateral cyclic loadings, by considering the effects of wind, waves, and ice. A series of centrifuge tests are conducted in order to analyze these behaviors in detail, and OWT models with the original single-pile as well as wheel-only foundations are tested for comparison. Based on these tests, the accumulated lateral displacement and stiffness during cyclic loadings are presented, and the results indicate that the hybrid foundation exhibits a larger cyclic capacity than the other foundations. The influence of the cycle numbers, cyclic loading characteristics, and soil properties is examined during the tests; furthermore, the effects of these factors on the model deformation responses are illustrated. This study proposes the first analytical method for quantitatively estimating the cyclic lateral displacement of the new hybrid foundation in service conditions, and a degradation coefficient is recommended based on the test results.

Chemistry ahead of a flame, in the finite zone of reactive mixture behind the precursor shock, or, more generally, behind a source of an unburned mixture, always results in a hot spot appearing ahead of the flame. Diffusion-driven flames propagate at negligible speeds compared with the speed of sound and can thus be approximated as contact surfaces. Downstream, the hot spot triggers a weak detonation that slows down to the Chapman-Jouguet speed and quickly becomes a strong wave. Eventually, this wave reaches the contact surface: chemistry stops and a reflection moves upstream. If the source delivers fresh mixture at a velocity below a specific threshold, then the hot spot does not initially trigger a combustion wave on its upstream side, but only an inert shock. This shock, however, warms up the mixture, resulting in a much shorter ignition time. If ignition behind this second shock occurs before the reflection of the downstream wave on the contact surface reaches the location of this second ignition point, a second hot spot forms, on these much shorter time and length scales. This second hot spot triggers a second identical chain of events, which triggers a third one, and so forth, resulting in an embedded sequence of ignition and shock formation. Each of these appears slightly further downstream, on increasingly shorter scales, triggering the next events in the sequence. Eventually, a sequence of shock mergers results in a strong Chapman-Jouguet wave, completing transition to detonation. The condition for reflection to take longer than ignition yields a transition criterion. The analysis assumes high activation energy and a ratio of specific heat close to unity, and the transition criterion appears as a specific distinguished limit.", "key_words": null, "affil": null, "citedby_count": "4"}

The dynamics of roaming versus radical formation is studied with a reduced dimensional trajectory approach. The requisite potential energy surface is obtained from an interpolative moving least squares fit to wide-ranging ab initio data for the long-range interactions between methyl and methoxy. The predicted roaming and radical micro-canonical fluxes are incorporated in a master equation treatment of the temperature and pressure dependence of the dissociation process. The tight (i.e., non-roaming) transition states leading to a variety of additional molecular fragments are also included in the master equation analysis, but are predicted to have a negligible contribution to product formation. The final theoretical results reliably reproduce the measured dissociation rate to radical products reported here and are well reproduced over the 500–2000K temperature range and the 0.01–300bar pressure range by the following modified Arrhenius parameters for the Troe falloff format: k 1 , ∞ ( T ) = 2.33 × 10 19 T - 0.661 exp ( - 42345 / T ) s - 1 k 1 , 0 ( T ) = 2.86 × 10 35 T - 11.4 exp ( - 46953 / T ) cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1 F cent ( T ) = exp ( - T / 880 ) The experimentally observed branching ratio of 0.19±0.07 provides a direct measure of the contribution from the roaming radical mechanism.

To better control the burning rate of a solid fuel, the effect of magnetic fields on the regression rate of solid fuel was experimentally and numerically investigated. In this experiment, the regression rates of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) rods under different types of magnetic field gradients were measured. Meanwhile, the morphological changes in the flame during combustion were recorded by a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. The experimental results indicated that the regression rate for PMMA varies regularly with various magnetic field gradients, with rates in the range from -32.5% to 10.8%. Simultaneously, the flame structure also changes. The numerical simulation that considered both gas-phase combustion and gas-solid heat transfer produced results that were in good agreement with the experiment. The results show that the change in the regression rate is a result of the magnetic force acting on the paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials. By changing the flow field, the magnetic force can change the flame shape and temperature distribution. This alters the heat exchanged between the gas and the fuel surface and thus, changes the burning rate. It was found that the burning rate of solid fuel can be adjusted regularly by applying different types of non-uniform magnetic fields, and it may be used in the solid fuel ramjet burning rate modulation.", "key_words": ["Magnetic field gradient", "Solid fuel", "Regression rate", "Numerical simulation", "Combustion control"], "affil": null, "citedby_count": "2"}

Therefore, a model coupling heat and mass transfer as well as the chemical reaction is set up and validated with recently published experimental data for an indirectly heated fixed bed with an operating range between 8.7 and 470 kPa. The simulation reveals that in this design with a thin reactive layer mass transfer is not limiting, while thermal losses have a significant influence and thus have to be accounted for in the model.

In protected reserves innovative systems should be developed to facing problems of pollution, exhaust fumes and noise. These underlying conditions lead to special challenges for excursions ships. The switching to a cleaner, safer and quieter transport system seems to be a sustainable long-term solution for the problems of ecological areas, where more electric ship can be an important part of the solution and principally for the last mile. This paper presents a design approach of a hybrid Energy Storage Systems (ESS) for new generation of series hybrid excursion ship devoted to ecological areas to avoid any emission during the casting-off and the docking maneuvers. The main purpose of the paper is to show that, even if the hybrid ESS plus series-hybrid propulsion were already used to other vehicles, the gain for a ship with no regenerative capability is not evident. The proposed hybridization is built upon a fully-active parallel topology with battery and supercapacitors. The sizing methodology and the configuration of the ESS are detailed. For a real mission profile in Alster Lake (Hamburg, Germany) it is shown that a small battery pack of 2 kWh with a supercapacitor bank of 0.54 kWh are necessary to have zero-emission maneuvers. The graphical formalism Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) is used to describe the model and to establish an energy analysis tool. An inversion-based control scheme is then deduced from the EMR and simulation results are provided to validate the proposed methodology. The usage of hybrid ESS avoids 1.39 kg of CO2 during the casting-off and docking maneuvers despite increasing consumption of 0.2 l (+8%). However, the plug-in capability can be introduced and a recharge of the battery when the ship is docked could reduce the global consumption and emissions by 20% in comparison to the original ship.", "key_words": ["Electric excursion ship", "Supercapacitors", "Battery", "Zero-emission maneuvers", "Energetic Macroscopic Representation"]}

CaSO4 has emerged as an alternative material with much lower cost and higher oxygen storage capacity compared to metal oxide based oxygen carrier. In principle, CaSO4 is reduced by CO and H2 (coal gasification products) generating CaS, CO2 and H2O, and then the solid product CaS is regenerated back to CaSO4 in air. Research on the reactions of CaSO4 and CaS is not only important for understanding the reaction mechanism and parameters for the new CLC technology but also of high interest in understanding the sulfur chemistry in fluidized bed combustion and gasification.

When combustion instabilities occur, the combustion process is characterised by the coupling of various non-linear phenomena, which can lead to the formation of either a limit cycle or chaos. The intrinsic highly non-linear behaviour, especially when chaos arises, poses a major problem for the formulation of good predictions and the design of reliable control systems. Due to the relevant number of degree of freedom and to the non-linear coupling of different phenomena, the mathematical modeling of combustion instabilities is computationally heavy and may produce an unsatisfactory correspondence between simulated and experimental data. Analogous problems arise also from the uncertainty for the parameters of the process, such as the local velocity of the flame front (and, hence, the reaction rate and the exhausted temperatures), and their unpredictable variations. In fact, note that most of the chemical and thermo-physical variables both strongly depend and influence the instantaneous displacement of the flame front, which is positioned on the unstationary eddies external surface. In order to obtain a reliable model for thermo-acoustic combustion instabilities, a different approach was chosen in this paper. The black-box identification of an experimental combustion chamber was obtained by means of a generalized NARMAX model. The model was implemented by training a Multilayer Perceptron artificial neural network with input-output experimental data. The main advantages of the proposed approach consisted in the natural ability of neural networks in modeling nonlinear dynamics in a fast and simple way and in the possibility to address the process to be modeled as an input-output black box, with little or no mathematical information on the system.

Radiation from gaseous species and soot are calculated by a discrete-ordinate method with a statistical narrow-band correlated-k based band model. The discretized sectional soot equations are solved simultaneously to ensure convergence. Parallel computation with the domain decomposition method is used to save computational time.

Newly defined parameters are introduced as power loss parameter (PLOS), effective power loss parameter (EPLOS) and Carnot-Brayton shape factor (CBSF) for a better assessment of the performance and power losses throughout the operation of the engine cycle. In addition, optimization functions, such as maximum power (MP), maximum power density (MPD), ecological coefficient of performance (ECOP) and ecological function (ECOL) are considered and their optimal operation conditions are compared with respect to each other. Some important evaluations are made for the optimal operation conditions with respect to the ideal Carnot cycle case and also with respect to the ideal Brayton cycle case. Power losses due to internal irreversibilities, as a result of the second law of thermodynamics and due to shape of the cycle model are classified and evaluated. In addition, this paper introduces an assessment of the performance of the turbojet engines in terms of a mass flow rate, gas generator speed and shaft force models as well as considerations for variations of heat leakage. Various parameters affecting the performance analysis are also considered such as compressor pressure ratio θ c , compressor and turbine efficiencies ( η c and η t respectively), altitude and flight Mach number M ∞ . The comparisons show that the maximum power conditions have the lowest EPLOS but the highest PLOS values with respect to the other optimal function criterions, indicating the effect of the internal irreversibilities at the lowest but exergy destruction for the environment at the highest.", "key_words": ["Turbojet engines", "Irreversible Brayton cycle", "Maximum power", "Maximum power density", "Ecological function", "Ecological coefficient of performance"]}

Specifically, the HE products equation-of-state (EOS), which largely determines the detonating HE’s ability to do useful work on its surroundings, is typically inferred from cylinder expansion tests where metal-confined HE cylinders are detonated and the ensuing outer confiner wall-expansion trajectory is recorded. Expensive, iterative comparisons to multimaterial hydrodynamic (or “hydrocode”) simulations of these experiments are then used to constrain the parameters of the chosen EOS form.

Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) is used to provide load shifted thermal energy at small temperature swing with high storage density, hence an overall more compact energy system. However, the low thermal conductivity of the majority of the phase change materials (PCMs) necessitates delicate design of the active storage unit to meet power demand (high enough energy extraction/storage per amount of time). A performance analysis of two LHTES configurations is carried out in this work. Thermal charge and discharge rate of single PCM is compared with multistage LHTES using a cascade design of multiple PCMs at various phase change temperatures in a submerged finned pipe heat exchanger design. The work is conducted with a validated finite element based numerical simulation for evaluation of both full charge/discharge cycle and continuous half charge/discharge cycles. The results show that in full charge/discharge mode, the thermal performance of a multi-PCM LHTES may be improved by 10–40% as compared to that of a homogeneous single-PCM storage unit in terms of thermal charge/discharge rate. This is due to the capability of the multistage LHTES to maintain a higher driving temperature difference for the heat transfer process in the charging and discharging processes. In half charge/discharge cycling mode, however, the thermal power rating performance of multi-PCM storage converges towards that of the single-PCM storage in melting process, reducing thus the multi-PCM enhancement.

The performance of this model is compared to the performance of both the double diode and the modified double diode models of the same cell/module. Therefore, there is a persistent need to keep searching for a more accurate optimization algorithm to estimate the more complicated models’ parameters. Hence, a proper optimization algorithm which is called Moth-Flame Optimizer (MFO), is proposed as a new optimization algorithm for the parameter extraction process of the three tested models based on data measured at laboratory and other data reported at previous literature. To verify the performance of the suggested technique, its results are compared with the results of the most recent and powerful techniques in the literature such as Hybrid Evolutionary (DEIM) and Flower Pollination (FPA) algorithms.

The method is then applied to the case of waste heat recovery from a large marine diesel engine. A multistage axial turbine model is presented and validated with the best available data from literature. The methodology allows the identification of the most suitable working fluid considering the trade-off between cycle and multistage turbine designs. The results of the optimization of cycle and turbine suggest that the fluid n-butane yields the best compromise in terms of cycle net power output, turbine cost and efficiency for the considered case study.

To date, dynamic modelling to simulate coupled solar/combustion heating and steam gasification using real solar irradiation data has never been proposed and could be used to predict the annual performance of large-scale solar gasification plants. In this study, a dynamic mathematical model of a scaled-up solar gasification reactor was developed. The model was composed of a system of differential equations that were derived from unsteady mass and energy conservation equations. After an experimental validation step with the results from a lab-scale solar reactor, the dynamic model was applied at large scale to determine the reactor temperature and syngas production evolution during continuous day and night operation in both solar-only (allothermal) and hybrid solar/autothermal modes. Different reactants feeding management strategies were proposed and compared with the aim of achieving enhanced syngas productivity and optimized use of solar energy during solar-aided steam gasification. It was shown that the hybrid mode with partial oxy-combustion of the feedstock and dynamic feeding control results in the most stable process operation upon fluctuating solar power input, while ensuring continuous production of H2 and CO at night and during cloudy periods.\n               ", "key_words": ["Solar energy", "Biomass", "Hybrid gasification reactor", "Continuous operation strategy", "Dynamic modelling"]}

This work addresses hybrid solar-autothermal gasification of mm-sized beech wood particles in a lab-scale 1.5 kWth spouted-bed reactor. Hybridization under reduced solar power input was performed by injecting oxygen and additional biomass inside the gasifier for complementary heat supply. Increasing O2:C molar ratios (in the range 0.14–0.58) allowed to heat the reactor cavity and walls progressively, while gradually impairing the reactor performance with an increase of the syngas CO2 content and a decrease of the reactor cold gas efficiency (CGE). Gasification with mixed H2O and O2 was then assessed at thermodynamic equilibrium and global trends were validated experimentally, showing that control of H2:CO ratio was compatible with in-situ combustion. The impact of reaction temperature (1200–1300 °C) and heating mode (direct or indirect) was experimentally studied during both allothermal and hybrid gasification. Higher H2 and CO yields were achieved at high temperatures (1300 °C) under direct reactor heating.

A larger median pore-throat radius benefits to salt ion diffusing out of sample, thus a higher salt ion diffusion rate appears. The liquid can cause the clay-swelling which has the potential to reduce the salt ion diffusion channel, thus the higher the clay content, the lower the salt ion diffusion rate.

The laser extinction measurement method and the rapid thermocouple insertion technique are used to obtain soot volume fraction profiles and temperature profiles, respectively. Thermophoretic sampling followed by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to study the morphology of soot particles at different locations inside the flame. Soot formation on the centerline appears to be different from conventional models. Liquid-like particles, which are transparent at the wavelength of 623nm, are formed and grow up to a volume equivalent diameter of dp\n                     \n                     =60nm at temperatures below T\n                     =1500K. When the temperature exceeds 1500K, transition of the transparent particles to the mature agglomerated particles happens immediately, i.e. in less than 12ms. The volume of the liquid-like particles just before the start of their transformation to solid is about five times larger than the volume of mature primary particles. This significant size difference suggests that a large liquid-like particle does not transform into a single primary particle. In addition, multiple dark nuclei are observed in the liquid-like particles prior to carbonization. The significant size discrepancy and the presence of multiple dark nuclei may indicate that primary particle formation and agglomeration on the centerline happen inside the liquid-like particles. In contrast to the centerline, on another streamline with a significantly different temperature history, soot particles form from relatively small liquid-like particles. These particles have the same size as mature primary particles. Carbonization happens early on the streamline. A single dark nucleus grows inside each liquid-like particle and primary particles agglomerate after carbonization is completed. Most of the currently used computational soot models consider a single evolution process for all of the streamlines inside the flame which may not be an accurate assumption. This study shows that soot evolution processes may be different across the flame and are a function of temperature and the concentration of specific species inside the flame.\n               ", "key_words": ["Evolution of soot morphology", "Soot aggregate structure", "Liquid-like particles", "Jet A-1 surrogate", "Kerosene", "Laminar coflow diffusion flame"], "scp_id": "84880616307", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "114"}

Boreholes are drilled and then lined with steel tubes so that a mixture of water and sand with small quantities of chemicals – the fracking fluid – can be pumped into them at very high pressure. The sand grains that wedge into the cracks induced in the shale rock by a ‘perforating gun’ then releases gas which returns up the tubes. In the United Kingdom (UK) exploratory drilling is at an early stage, with licences being issued to drill a limited number of test boreholes around the country. However, such activities are already meeting community resistance and controversy. Like all energy technologies it exhibits unwanted ‘side-effects’; these simply differ in their level of severity between the various options. Shale gas may make, for example, a contribution to attaining the UK’s statutory ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions targets, but only if appropriate and robust regulations are enforced. The benefits and disadvantages of shale gas fracking are therefore discussed in order to illustrate a ‘balance sheet’ approach. It is also argued that it is desirable to bring together experts from a range of disciplines in order to carry out energy technology assessments. That should draw on and interact with national and local stakeholders: ‘actors’ both large and small.

Liquid cooled systems require active control of coolant temperature and flow rate to match heat rejection to heat generation.

In an evaporatively cooled system, liquid water is injected directly into the cathode flow channels where it evaporates, both cooling and humidifying the stack. This paper uses a validated simulation to explore the inherent temperature regulation abilities of an evaporatively cooled PEMFC stack across a range of current profiles and drive cycles. Results show that throughout the normal operating current range, stack temperature varies by less than ± 2.0 °C, this is comparable to liquid cooling but without the need for active temperature control. The introduction of variable operating pressure and cathode stoichiometry using proportional integral control, can further reduce temperature variation to ± 1.0 °C and ±1.2 °C respectively for step increases in current demand. Variable operating pressure is also shown to improve warm up time and reduce heat loss at low operating loads.", "key_words": ["Thermal management", "Thermal", "Stack", "Evaporative", "Cooling", "PEM"]}

Therefore, we should expect a relation between the sedimentary basin, the exploitation of its fossil fuels, and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is the dominant greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels, and it comprises more than half of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Among the methods proposed for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide, is disposal into porous formations deep in sedimentary basins. This includes injection into hydrocarbon reservoirs to enhance oil and gas recovery and the long-term sequestration in aquifers. The methodology for proving the latter concept has been developed in the Alberta Basin, Canada. It is now being practiced in the North Sea and considered in Indonesia. A further development is the concept of injecting carbon dioxide, from the burning of fossil fuels, into coal-beds to remove methane. This would have the dual result of increasing the production of methane, a more environmentally friendly fossil fuel than coal or oil, and using waste carbon dioxide to a useful purpose. While burning the recovered methane will result in more carbon dioxide, clearly this additional carbon dioxide can either be used to recover more methane or be disposed of underground in suitable aquifers. There is, thus, a serendipitous association of sedimentary basins, their contained fossil fuels and the means of exploiting or disposing of the greenhouse gases produced from the fossil fuels.

If the absence of buoyant flows fundamentally affects combustion mechanisms, the possibility of atmospheric design in spacecraft environment provides a new leverage, not usually available on Earth. Investigating a non-buoyant flame spreading over the polyethylene coating of an electrical wire in an opposed laminar flow, the previous paper highlighted how flow conditions, namely oxygen content, flow velocity, and ambient pressure, affected spread rate and soot formation rate. The implementation of the Broadband Modulated Absorption/Emission (B-MAE) technique provided mappings of soot temperature and volume fraction in the spreading flames during parabolic flights. In this second paper, the link between these microscopic observations and new macroscopic findings regarding the influence of flow conditions on the smoke production of a flame in the same configuration is presented. Taking into account other requirements of space exploration, atmospheric conditions below normoxic values present a clear interest from a fire safety perspective. In the process, a threshold temperature at which soot oxidation reactions are frozen is identified. The value of 1400 K brought forward conforms with past measurements performed at normal gravity, while discrepancies with previous microgravity measurements are addressed.

In this study, cyclic variations and prior-cycle effects of ion current signals are analyzed by comparing against pressure transducer signals using time-series methods in an HCCI engine. Additionally, the effects of various calibrated ion signal intensities are tested by adding cesium acetate (CsOAc) to the base fuel. Nonlinear characteristics of ion current signals are identified to cause strong cyclic variations through a single-zone model analysis with different equivalence ratios. By analyzing the time series, return maps, and coefficient of variations (CoV), the study finds that the stability of the ion signals can be largely improved by adding CsOAc due to the low ionization energy. After reconstructing a complex, nonlinear dynamical system model with symbol-sequence statistics, the measured cycle-resolved data of the ion current signal is analyzed to determine the pattern structures within prior cycles of fixed length, which is optimized by a modified Shannon entropy calculation. The results suggest that long, consecutive symbols of the ion current signal can be reliably predicted through the application of designed deterministic patterns especially when a small amount of CsOAc is added, although the ion current signal is normally considered a localized information provider and affected by many dynamical factors. Consequently, ion current signals are very promising for model-based control systems in HCCI engines with tolerable amounts of signal enhancing additives.", "key_words": ["HCCI", "Cyclic variations", "Ion current sensing", "Fuel additives", "Symbol-sequence statistics"], "scp_id": "84957872779", "affil": [{"affilname": "University of Massachusetts Lowell", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "University of California, Berkeley", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "University of Brighton", "contry": "United Kingdom"}], "citedby_count": "25"}

Differential diffusion effects are systematically isolated by performing simulations with both non-unity and unity Lewis numbers. Different unburnt temperatures and turbulence intensities are used and their effects on the flame structure and chemical source terms are investigated. As the unburnt gases are preheated, the viscosity ratio across the flame is reduced and the Karlovitz number at the reaction zone is increased. The increase in turbulence intensity suppresses differential diffusion effects on the flame structure (i.e. species dependence on temperature). However, differential diffusion effects on the chemical source terms are still noticeable even at the highest Karlovitz number simulated. Simulations with differential diffusion effects exhibit lower mean fuel consumption and heat release rates than their unity Lewis number counterparts. However, the difference is reduced as the reaction zone Karlovitz number is increased. Transition to distributed burning is characterized by a broadening of the reaction zone resulting from enhanced turbulent mixing. Local extinctions in the burning rate are observed only in non-unity Lewis number simulations and their probability decreases at high Karlovitz numbers.

A novel major arc-shaped linear cavity receiver with a lunate channel based on the black cavity effect principle for parabolic trough solar collectors is proposed in this work. The effects of the inclination angle, collecting temperature, surface emissivity and aperture width on the heat loss are thoroughly analyzed with a two-dimensional numerical model coupling natural convection with surface radiation. In addition, the thermal performance of the proposed linear cavity receiver is compared with that of the Solel’s UVAC series evacuated collector tube. The results show that: (1) The natural convection heat loss is significantly affected by the inclination angle, while the radiation heat loss is mainly affected by the surface emissivity and the collecting temperature. (2) The aperture width of the receiver has a great impact on the thermal performance. The larger the aperture width is, the greater the heat losses. However, the aperture width can also affect the optical performance and the manufacturing cost. The reasonable aperture width for this kind of linear cavity receiver is about 50–70 mm with consideration of all these factors. (3) The proposed linear cavity receiver demonstrates comparative or even better thermal performance as traditional evacuated collector tubes, especially in high temperature range. In general, the proposed linear cavity receiver has the comparative shape and size as the traditional evacuated collector tubes. More importantly, it has the advantages of raising the collecting temperature and reducing the production and maintenance costs. Therefore, it can be used to replace the evacuated collector tube which has poor performance due to long-term operation.", "key_words": ["Cavity receiver", "Linear receiver", "Parabolic trough solar collector", "Thermal performance", "Natural convection", "Surface radiation"], "scp_id": "85059700494"}

Mg(OH)2 produced via a closed loop reaction of serpentinite and ammonium sulfate (AS), precipitation of Mg(OH)2 and AS looping/recovery binds CO2 into a thermodynamically stable, environmentally benign and leak-free magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). We used results from laboratory, modeling and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to determine the extent to which magnesium (Mg) from serpentinite rock can be converted to Mg(OH)2, the effects of reaction parameters, scalability and the associated life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). We found that reaction temperature positively affects Mg extraction from serpentinite, reaching a maximum yield at different temperatures depending on the reaction time. Also, the reactor properties affect the extraction results as the optimal extraction yield and conditions reported for different reactors differ. While the process of producing Mg(OH)2 is promising, it also possesses a level of energy and environmental burden that cannot be ignored when considering large scale implementation. At 100% conversion and recovery of reagent, the CO2 mineralization process has a life cycle global warming potential (GWP) of 433kg CO2 equivalents per ton CO2 (CO2e/t-CO2).

Further, the higher altitudes associated with hyper/supersonic flight make the emission of NOx critical for the ozone layer. In fact, at current subsonic flight altitudes in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, NOx emissions are associated with ozone production whereas, at altitude of 20,000–30,000 m, which corresponds closely to the maximum ozone density, NOx can catalyze ozone destruction. Reduction of the NOx Emission Index (grams of emission produced per kilogram of fuel consumed) remains therefore a primary concern. This paper has the goal to investigate possible strategies to reduce NOx emissions from H2 combustion. Since these increase when burning fuel near stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios, a strategy simulated in this study to reduce NOx production consists in operating at lean or very lean equivalence ratios (thanks to the wider flammability limits of the hydrogen-air flames compared to kerosene-air flames), or in reducing the combustor length (thanks to the higher flame speed of hydrogen compared to other fuels. In this paper, the RQL (Rich-Quench-Lean) strategy for the NOx abatement is proposed for a high speed hydrogen fuelled vehicle.

But, seasonal variation in heat demand throughout the year affects the operation of CHP plants. This fluctuation in the CHP operation cause less annual operating hours for the plant equipment and is also not profitable for stakeholders. This study aims to assess the technical potential of integrated gasification process with existing CHP plants for either dimethyl ether (DME) or methanol production through refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Process integration considers that the CHP plant provides the necessary heat for biofuel synthesis during off-peak hours. Mass and heat integration methods are used to develop and simulate the polygeneration processes for heat, power, and biofuel production. Both technical and economic indicators are reported and compared to assess the potential for both biofuels through process integration. Annual operation data of a real CHP plant has been extracted to evaluate the integrated processes. A flexible gasification configuration is selected for the integrated approach i.e. CHP runs at full load to provide the heat demand and only the excess heat of CHP plant is utilized for biofuel production. The energetic efficiencies of the polygeneration systems are compared with the standalone systems. Technical analysis of process integration shows the enhancement of the operational capacity of CHP during off-peak hours and it can produce biofuels without compromising the annual heat demand. Production of methanol through process integration shows ∼67% energetic efficiency while methanol production gives ∼65%. The efficiencies are higher than standalone DME and methanol processes (51% and 53%, respectively) but lower than standalone CHP plant i.e. 81%, however the process integration increases the operating time of the CHP plant with more economic benefits. Economic analysis coupled with uncertainty analysis through Monte Carlo simulations shows that by integrating CHP with gasifier to produce biofuels is significantly profitable as compared with only heat and electricity production. But, DME as a potential product shows more economic benefits than methanol.

To solve this mismatch, a specially designed, fixed-inverter hybrid heat pump system incorporating a fixed-speed compressor and an inverter-driven, variable-speed compressor was developed and tested in a real WWTP. In this hybrid configuration, to improve load response and energy efficiency, the base-heat load was covered by the fixed-speed compressor consuming relatively less energy than the variable-speed type at nominal power, and the remaining varying load was handled by the inverter compressor which exhibits a high load-match function while consuming relatively greater energy.

In the present study, the lignolytic bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis LZ-K2 was isolated from rotten wood. The isolate showed high lipid production and high efficiency of lignin degradation. The lipid production of LZ-K2 grown in corn straw medium with alkali pretreatment, acid pretreatment, and without chemical pretreatment were 0.083 g/L, 0.069 g/L, and 0.072 g/L, respectively. Fatty acids (C14-C24), especially palmitic acid (C16:0; 38.9%), were also accumulated in the untreated corn straw cultures. Results confirmed that the enzyme system and Fenton reaction are the major pathways for lignin depolymerization. In addition, the presence of a critical lignin-degrading enzymes, other than cellulase and hemicellulase, was revealed by the genome analysis. Moreover, the proteome of LZ-K2 showed enzymes, mainly glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, which are involved in the Fenton reaction and β-ketoadipate pathway. Unique enzymes of oleaginous microorganisms, such as acetyl CoA carboxylase, were also identified in LZ-K2.

Optical band gap measurements using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy are also performed to compare with the STS measurements. The suitability of STS in measuring electronic band gaps is first demonstrated through measurements using reference materials: the electronic band gaps of naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene are found to be slightly larger than the respective optical band gaps, as expected, because of the over potential in the presence of a current. Flame-formed CNPs of three different particle size distributions were sampled and tested.

We evaluate this alternative by developing an engineering-economic model that computes the levelized cost of transporting captured CO2 through pipes of different diameters and over varying distances. The model also computes the additional energy use and resulting CO2 emissions involved in the transport and is used to arrive at a generalized correlation for estimating the cost of CO2 transport ($/tonne/km) for different mass flow rates. Model results indicate that the cost for transporting CO2 could be significantly reduced using a large-diameter trunkline networked to pipelines from individual CO2 sources.

The PEC formulation utilizes a drift term to assess the compliance of specific combustion submodels with the underlying flow-field representation. This drift term is extended to consider autoignition delay as a process of interest, and the ignition delay time of a homogeneous isobaric reactor is utilized as surrogate. Combustion models considered are the steady-state flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model and a finite-rate chemistry (FRC) model. Large-eddy simulations are performed and the proposed PEC autoignition formulation (PEC-AI) is demonstrated to identify localized regions that require a finite-rate chemistry description in order to accurately capture the transient ignition dynamics. The model is employed to examine the stochasticity of the autoignition in the turbulent environment by performing ensemble simulations to construct probability distributions of ignition time and ignition locations. Comparisons with measurements show the ability of PEC-AI in capturing the transient ignition dynamics and flame lift-off through drift-term adaptation with comparable accuracy to FRC simulations at reduced cost.

The enhanced photo-catalytic activity can be attributed to several positive factors such as the formation of composite hydrogels and the quantum size effect of the CdS nanoparticles nanomaterials. The formation of the composite hydrogel improves the specific surface area of the catalyst and increases the active site on the catalyst surface. The quantum size effects of the CdS nanoparticles effectively reduce the recombination probability of electrons and holes.

However, because of the shortcomings of using agricultural (food supply problems) and lingo-cellulosic biomass (low biomass availability and processing yield) as feedstock, use of micro-algal biomass has been considered for use as a feedstock for biodiesel (biofuel). Thus, in this study we developed a deterministic mathematical programming model for strategic planning design of a microalgae biomass-to-biodiesel supply chain network (MBBSCN) from feedstock fields to end users that simultaneously satisfies resource constraints, demand constraints, and technology over a long-term planning horizon. The proposed deterministic model can help to determine where and how much feedstock to be transported, and where and how many refineries to be constructed to minimize the expected total cost including the co-product (naphtha and power) benefit.

Mixtures of CH4-air and C3H8-air are issued from the burner tube with mean flow velocity U = 0.6 m/s. The burner tube is rotated up to 1400 rpm (swirl number S = 1.58). An oscillating flame with large amplitude is formed between a conical-shape flame and a plateau flame under the condition of Lewis number Le > 1 mixtures (rich CH4-air and lean C3H8-air mixtures). In contrast, for Le ≤ 1 mixtures (lean CH4-air and rich C3H8-air), asymmetric, eccentric flame or tilted flame is formed under the same swirl number range.

The flame tip flickering frequency ν is insensitive to burner rotation for S < 0.11. For S > 0.11, ν decreases linearly with increasing S. As S exceeds 0.11, a minimum value of axial mean velocity along the center line uj,m due to flow divergence is found and it has a linear relationship with ν. This result shows that uj,m has direct control of the oscillation frequency. When S approaches unity, the flame oscillation amplitude increases by a factor of 5, compared to the flickering amplitude of a conical-shape flame. This is accompanied by a hysteresis variation in the flame curvature from positive to negative and the thermo-diffusive zone thickness varying from small to large.

In this study the flow distribution in a CPHE reformer, which uses a coated wire-mesh catalyst, is considered to investigate the effect of catalyst wire-mesh pressure drop characteristics on flow distribution in the CPHE reformer. Flow distribution in a CPHE reformer is rarely uniform due to inlet and exhaust manifold design. Poorly-designed manifolds may lead to severe flow maldistribution, flow reversal in some of the CPHE reformer channels and increased overall pressure drop. Excessive flow maldistribution can significantly reduce the CPHE reformer performance. Detailed three-dimensional models are used to investigate the flow distribution at three different catalyst wire-mesh pressure drop coefficients and at five different flow rates. Experiments are performed on a single CPHE reformer channel to evaluate the pressure drop characteristics of the catalyst wire-mesh in the current CPHE reformer design. The results are used in the numerical model where the catalyst zone is simulated as domains with momentum source to account for the pressure drop. The numerical model is verified experimentally, numerical and experimental results are found to be in good agreement. The study shows that severe flow maldistribution exists in the current reformer stack. At nominal load some channels in the CPHE reformer receive up to four times the average mass flow, while other channels have reversed flow.

However, the insufficient corrosion resistance and relatively high interfacial contact resistance (ICR) become the major obstacles to the widespread use of stainless steel bipolar plates. In this work, active screen plasma nitriding (ASPN), a novel plasma nitriding technique, was used to modify the surface of 316 austenitic stainless steel. A variety of analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), glow discharge optical emission spectrometer (GDOES), were employed to characterize the nitrided samples.

The response of methane/air and propane/air flames for cylindrical injectors of radii R = 11 , 7, 1.5 and 1.0 mm is examined. The steady flames investigated all feature the same flame tip half-angle α = 14 . 5 o , i.e., the same aspect ratio h / R = 4 , where h is the flame height. When the injector radius R is large compared to the flame thickness δ, the FTF measurements are shown to collapse on the same response curve when they are plotted as a function of the reduced frequency ω * = ω R / ( S L cos α ) , where ω is the forcing angular frequency and SL the laminar burning velocity. When the injector size is reduced and δ/R becomes sizable, additional parameters are needed to fully describe the FTF. The Lewis number and flame temperature are shown to alter the low frequency behavior of the FTF of flames stabilized above small injectors. One of the main features of these flames is FTF gain values exceeding unity, called gain overshoots, at low reduced frequencies. Larger FTF gain overshoots are found as the injector size is reduced or as the flame temperature is reduced. A model accounting for mutual flame interactions and unsteady heat and mass transfer at the flame base is derived for the reduced frequency ω * 0 corresponding to the peak FTF gain values. This expression is shown to better match measurements than previous models based on planar flames that only consider unsteady heat and mass transfer between the flame stand-off position at ψ 0 and the burner. The main finding is that mutual flame interactions due to interpenetrating diffusion layers and unsteady heat transfer at the flame base both lead to FTF gain values exceeding unity but the former mechanism is largely dominant for the configurations investigated in this study.

However, the efficiency and reliability of these methods are limited due to heuristic or stochastic searching strategies. In this paper, by combining the trust-region reflective (TRR) deterministic algorithm with the artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic algorithm, a new hybrid algorithm ABC-TRR is proposed to improve the parameter extraction of PV models. The ABC-TRR algorithm combines the global exploration capability of the ABC and the local exploitation of the TRR, which achieves a good tradeoff among accuracy, convergence and reliability. The proposed ABC-TRR hybrid algorithm is evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using the standard I-V curves of the benchmark Photowatt-PWP201 PV module and RTC France solar cell as well as the measured I-V curves of a laboratory PV module/string/array. Comprehensive experimental analysis and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed ABC-TRR algorithm achieves the same level of accuracy as the best reported algorithms with the highest overall reliability. More importantly, the ABC-TRR algorithm converges 4.69 times faster than the best-reported algorithms on average. In view of these advantages, the proposed ABC-TRR algorithm is a promising alternative for accurately, efficiently and reliably extracting the parameters of PV models from measured I-V curves.

The numerical model employed uses a gas-phase kinetic mechanism which describes the pyrolysis and oxidation of the fuel, and the formation of PAHs. The detailed mechanism is moderately reduced and coupled to a sectional soot particle dynamics model to solve the combustion chemistry and soot formation. The model is able to accurately predict the trends observed experimentally with increasing mole fraction of n-propylbenzene in the liquid fuel mixture without any tuning of the model parameters for different cases. Quantitatively, the model underpredicts the increase of soot production with n-propylbenzene addition, which could be attributed to the underprediction of PAH formation or the assumption of a constant soot particle surface reactivity. For the target flames in this study, the simulation results show that mixing n-propylbenzene into the liquid fuel mixture accelerates soot inception, and increases PAH surface addition. The aromatic fuel chemistry effect is stronger along the flame centerline than along the wing, which is consistent with the experimental results. A sensitivity analysis of the chemical pathways suggests that the n-propylbenzene forms PAH via direct pathways without the need to break the aromatic ring unlike n-dodecane which breaks down to C1\n                     C4 species; this results in PAH forming earlier and in greater magnitude.

This suggests that the addition of n-propylbenzene would not increase soot production to the same extent as would be anticipated from the increase in PAH formation.

Distinguished from the conventional energy harvesters that convert various mechanical motions to vibrations of a mechanical oscillator with high resonant frequency, the proposed approach converts vibrations or linear reciprocating motions to either rapid rotation motion or high-frequency small twisting vibration of a rotor, making the harvester well suited for harnessing ultra-low frequency mechanical motions. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach by applying it to electromagnetic energy harvesting from ultra-low frequency vibrations and human body motions.

A biomass ECP can be defined as a synergetic, multi-dimensional biomass conversion site with a highly integrated set of conversion technologies in which a multitude of regionally available biomass (residue) sources are converted into energy and materials. A techno-economic assessment is performed on a case study in the Netherlands to illustrate the concept and to comparatively assess the highly integrated system with two mono-dimensional models. The three evaluated models consist of (1) digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, (2) co-digestion of manure and co-substrates, and (3) integration. From a socio-economic point of view it can be concluded that it is economically and energetically more interesting to invest in the integrated model than in two separate models. The integration is economically feasible and environmental benefits can be realized. For example, the integrated model allows the implementation of a co-digester. Unmanaged manure would otherwise represent a constant pollution risk. However, from an investor’s standpoint one should firstly invest in the municipal solid waste digester since the net present value (NPV) of this mono-dimensional model is higher than that of the multi-dimensional model.

This identification is usually performed by forcing the combustor (for example, modulating its inlet velocity) and measuring its response. Two methods may be found in the literature to analyze this response: identification of transfer matrices (ITM) and flame transfer functions (FTF). In ITM approaches, the burner is considered as a “black box” and a two-port formulation (based on acoustic pressure and velocity perturbations) is used to construct a transfer matrix linking acoustic fluctuations on both sides of the burner. A drawback of this method is that in experiments, the measurement of unsteady pressure and velocity in burnt gases can be difficult. In FTF approaches, pressure measurements are replaced by a global heat release measurement (usually based on optical methods). The heat release fluctuations are then related to the flow velocity modulations at a reference point (usually the combustor inlet) through a transfer function. This paper uses a compressible numerical simulation of a forced laminar Bunsen flame to analyze FTF and ITM methods. Results show that FTF approaches lead to an ill-defined problem as soon as the reference point is not close enough to the chamber. This “compactness” limit is quantified here in terms of distance between the reference point and the local chamber. The source of the problem is that FTF approaches correlate heat release fluctuations to velocity oscillations only: extended FTF models are then proposed using the local unsteady pressure as well as the velocity upstream of the flame to predict the heat release oscillations. These models are tested numerically and provide consistent values when the reference point location changes or when upstream and downstream conditions are varied. These results lead to simple recommendations for system identification.\n               ", "key_words": ["Flame transfer functions", "Identification of transfer matrices", "Boundary conditions", "Large eddy simulations"], "scp_id": "23844452852", "affil": [{"affilname": "CERFACS", "contry": "France"}, {"affilname": "IMFT Institut de Mécaniques des Fluides", "contry": "France"}], "citedby_count": "81"}

Amongst a wide variety of energy conversion technologies, crop residue gasification has been regarded as promising owing to its higher energy efficiency than that of direct combustion. However, prior to large-scale application of crop residue gasification, the lifetime environmental performance should be investigated to shed light on sustainable strategies. As traditional static life cycle assessment (LCA) does not include temporal information for dynamic processes, we proposed a dynamic life cycle assessment approach, which improves the static LCA approach by considering time-varying factors, e.g., greenhouse gas characterization factors and energy intensity. As the gasification project can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) discharge compared with traditional direct fuel combustion, trade-offs between the benefits of global warming mitigation and the impact on global warming of crop residue gasification should be considered. Therefore, indicators of net global warming mitigation benefit and global warming impact mitigation period are put forward to justify the feasibility of the crop residue gasification project. The proposed dynamic LCA and indicators were then applied to estimate the life cycle global warming impact of a crop residue gasification system in China. Results show that the crop residue gasification project has high net global warming mitigation benefit and a short global warming impact mitigation period, indicating its prominent potential in alleviating global warming impact. During the lifetime of the project, the largest emitters of the crop residue gasification project are the operation and construction stages, attributed mainly to the consumption of crop residue, electricity and steel. In addition, the comparison of the results obtained with both traditional and dynamic LCA approaches indicates that there is an exaggeration of the global warming impact reduction potential of crop residue gasification projects. This dynamic LCA can also make the decision maker acknowledge the real-time GHG performance during the lifetime of a production process, and thus make timely decisions to minimize the lifetime GHG emissions.", "key_words": ["Dynamic life cycle assessment", "Crop residue gasification", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Global warming impact"], "scp_id": "84895756147"}

This study proposed a methodology that identifies the burn inside the bowl using the inflection points of the heat release rate. A 3D CFD simulation that changed spark timing, equivalence ratio, and engine speed showed that this methodology can separate the fast combustion stage from the rest of the combustion event compared to the conventional spark-ignition theory that could not. In addition, this methodology showed that operating conditions controlled the flame location and combustion behavior inside the squish. For example, advanced spark timing, higher equivalence ratio, and lower engine speed advanced the transition point between the fast and the slow combustion stages but increased the mass of fuel inside the squish region. Moreover, the flame speed inside the bowl was ∼3 times higher than that inside the squish region. In addition, the lower burning rate after the transition point can decrease engine efficiency. Moreover, a higher engine speed optimized in-cylinder conditions at the transition between the two combustion events (which would suggest a better late combustion stage) but decreased the time available to complete the late combustion, which will probably increase emissions compared to conventional spark-ignition engines.", "key_words": ["Two-stage combustion", "Diesel engine", "Natural gas", "Spark ignition"]}

Both experimental and theoretical studies were carried out to reveal the mechanism for mercury removal. It was found that the high Hg0 removal efficiency of the adsorbent with 5wt% Mo was associated with the high sulphurization ratio of the precursors and the formation of graphene-like MoS2 nanosheets with just a few atomic layers. Moreover, a DFT-D model with periodical slab calculation was established to illustrate the interactions between the Hg0 atoms and the MoS2 (001) surface. The results showed that Hg0 atoms are chemically adsorbed on the MoS2 nanosheets and the most favourable adsorption site is the TMo position.

The system concentrates HCl(aq) between the electrolyzer and hydrolysis processes of the Copper–Chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycle for hydrogen production. The motivation behind this study is to investigate azeotropic separation of HCl(aq), as needed for integration of unit operations in the Cu–Cl cycle. The separation is only partial, as the mixture is unable to cross the azeotrope with only a single pressure. The distillation system consists primarily of one packed distillation column, which employs heating tapes and thermocouples to achieve a desired axial temperature profile. The column can be operated in batch or continuous mode. The distillate is H 2O(l) and the bottoms is HCl(aq) near the azeotropic concentration; feed concentrations are less than azeotrope. Thus, the degree of separation is determined to be independent of the feed concentration. The bottoms concentration varies from experiment to experiment, but does so independently of feed concentration, likely the result of corrosion impurities affecting the calculation of its concentration. It is found that HCl(aq) can be concentrated up to approximately 0.1068 mol/mol from an initial concentration of 0.0191 mol/mol. A simulation of pressure-swing distillation (PSD) is also performed, but due to safety constraints (a column operating at 10 atm must be certified to CSA B51), a single-pressure (single-column) distillation is physically performed. A single-pressure column is beneficial to the Cu–Cl cycle because it partially recycles HCl, which reduces the cost of the cycle, and still provides valuable results for analysis. The maximum HCl concentration achieved experimentally is 0.1068 mol/mol and the maximum HCl concentration determined from simulation is 0.11 mol/mol (the azeotropic concentration). The novelty of this research is that the experimental column built to study HCl partial separation is designed to be simple yet safe to integrate within the Cu–Cl cycle for hydrogen production.\n               ", "key_words": ["Hydrogen chloride", "Copper–chlorine cycle", "Azeotrope", "Distillation"]}

Phenyl radical was generated by the rapid thermal unimolecular dissociation of nitrosobenzene (C6H5NO), a clean precursor of C6H5 radical. The reaction progress was monitored by detecting C6H5 and NO simultaneously using visible laser absorption near 445 nm and mid-IR laser absorption near 5.517 µm, respectively. For the reaction C6H5NO → C6H5 + NO (R1), our data show an excellent agreement with earlier reports. The high-pressure limiting rate coefficient, by combining all available data, may be expressed as k 1 ∞ ( T ( K ) ) = 3.2 × 10 66 T − 15.2 e − 37743 / T s−1. This work reports the temperature dependence of the absorption cross-section of phenyl radical at 445 nm for first time. Our experiments indicate that the self-reaction of phenyl radicals yielding biphenyl, C6H5 + C6H5 → C6H5C6H5 (R2a), is a major channel. The rate coefficients of reaction (R2a) show a weak temperature dependence with an average value of k 2a = (6.91 ± 0.42) × 1012 cm3 mol−1 s−1 in the temperature range of 950–1300 K. Our measured data, k 2a(T, P = 1.1–1.5 atm), are found to be close to the high-pressure limiting rate coefficients. Combining with the literature low-temperature data, the self-recombination reaction of phenyl radicals may be expressed as k 2 a ∞ ( T = 300 − 1450 K ) = 2.8 × 10 17 T − 1.44 e − 540 / T cm3 mol−1 s−1.

This work aims to numerically study the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a side-ported rotary engine fueled with natural gas under different ignition positions andignition timings. Simulations were performed using multi-dimensional software ANASYS Fluent. Onthebasisof the software, a three-dimensional dynamic simulation model was established by writing dynamic mesh programs and choosing a detailed reaction mechanism. The three-dimensional dynamic simulation model, based on the chemical reaction kinetics, was also validated by the experimental data. Meanwhile, further simulations were then conducted to investigate how to impact the combustion process by the couplingfunction between ignitionoperating parameter and the flow field inside the cylinder. Simulation results showed that in order to improve the combustion efficiency, the trailing spark plugshould be located at the rear of the tumble zone and the ignition timing should be advanced properly. This was mainly caused by the trailing spark plug being located at the rear of the tumble zone, as it not only allowed the fuel in the rear of combustion chamber to be burnt without delay, but also permitted the acceleration of the flame propagation by the tumble. Meanwhile, with advanced ignition timing, the time between ignitiontiming and the timing of the tumble disappearance increased, which led to an increase of the tumble effect time used to improve the combustion rate. However, the drawback of this improved combustion was the slight increase in NO emissions. Under thecomputationalcondition, when the trailing spark plug scheme of case C coupled with an ignition timing of 50°CA (BTDC) was compared with the spark plug location and the ignition timing of theoriginalengine, it showed a27.4% increasein thepeak pressure.

Data used for the analysis include the spatial data of climate, soil, topography and land use, and literatures relevant for sweet sorghum studies. The results show that although sweet sorghum can be planted in the majority of lands in China, the suitable unused lands for large-scale planting (unit area not less than 100hm2) are only as much as 78.6×104 hm2; and the productive potentials of ethanol from these lands are 157.1×104–294.6×104 t/year, which can only meet 24.8–46.4% of current demand for E10 (gasoline mixed with 10% ethanol) in China (assumption of the energy efficiency of E10 is equivalent to that of pure petroleum).

However, experimental data describing the turbulent flame propagation behavior and the combustion mechanism of solid particle clouds have remained limited. In this work, the combustion of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particle clouds was studied by employing a unique fan-stirred constant-volume chamber. For the quasi-monodispersed particle clouds, the flame propagation velocity increased with the increase in the turbulence intensity and the decrease in the quasi-monodispersed particle size. However, the particle concentration had little effect on the flame propagation velocity, which is unique in a turbulent flow field. The consistency of the results between the current study of PMMA particle clouds and the previous study for coal particle clouds showed that the heterogeneous combustion of char particles had little effect on the turbulent flame propagation velocity of the solid particle clouds. Further, two types of quasi-monodispersed particles were mixed to study how the interactions between small and large (polydispersed) particles affect turbulent flame propagation. We found that the turbulent flame propagation velocity had a nonlinear relationship with the mass ratio of small particles (J-shaped curve). The turbulent flame propagation velocity slightly increased with low mass ratio of small particles, while it sharply increased with high mass ratio of small particles. Increasing the turbulence intensity and decreasing the primary particle (large particle) size can advance the starting point of the sharp increase. These unique features were explained by a mechanism considering the polydispersed interparticle interaction proposed by the authors. In the combustion of turbulent polydispersed particle clouds, the particle–particle agglomeration and the agglomeration break-up in the turbulent flow field affect turbulent flame propagation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the fundamental spherical turbulent flame propagation phenomenon and the mechanism of solid particle cloud combustion considering the polydispersed interparticle interactions.", "key_words": ["Solid particle cloud turbulent combustion", "Turbulent flame propagation", "Particle size effect", "Particle-particle interaction", "PMMA particle"], "affil": null, "citedby_count": "0"}

In this study, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of hybrid films of polypyrrole and silver (PPy-Ag). These films were prepared on biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate (BOPET) flexible substrates by eco-friendly one pot photo-polymerization method using aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) as photo initiator. Detailed characterization of the samples revealed that morphology of composite films reorganized with the change in AgNO3 concentration during synthesis. Increasing AgNO3 concentrations resulted in PPy films containing Ag nanoparticles, nanoclusters as well as macroclusters. With alteration in concentration and size of Ag particles in PPy matrix, it has been observed that the electrical conductivity of the films increased (1.5–17.3Scm−1), thermal conductivity decreased (0.16–0.002Wm−1 K−1), while Seebeck coefficient moderately reduced from 10.9μV/K to 5.8μV/K. Nearly same doping (N+/N∼0.35) content, improved conjugation length and incorporation of Ag between the PPy chains resulted in improved charge carrier mobility/electrical conductivity in the PPy–Ag films. It is proposed that the interface of Ag and PPy served as scattering sites for phonons, thus leading to reduction of thermal conductivity.

Methods In this study, we present a detailed buildings energy model with U.S. state-level representation, nested in an integrated assessment framework of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We project state-level buildings energy demand and its spatial pattern through the end of the century, considering the impact of climate change based on the estimates of heating and cooling degree days derived from downscaled USGS CASCaDE temperature data. Results The results indicate that climate change has a large impact on heating and cooling buildings energy and fuel use at the state level and that the 48 U.S. contiguous states exhibit a large spatial heterogeneity (ranges from −10% to+10% for total, −10% to+20% for electricity use and −20% to −5% for oil and gas use in the A2 scenario). Sensitivity analysis explores the potential implications of multiple driving forces, including climate action that would both change the price of energy and reduce climate change, the choice of climate models, and population and GDP growth. In addition, the 50-state building model is compared to a comparable version of the model which represents the entire United States as one region. Conclusions The study clearly demonstrates the spatially varying nature of fuel consumption changes that might occur from a changing climate. Although the study illustrates the importance of incorporating climate change into infrastructure-planning exercises, it also demonstrates that uncertainties about underlying drivers still must weigh heavily on these planning decisions. Finally, the study demonstrates that the 50-state building model provides both insights at the regional level and potentially better national-level estimates.

The present paper reports a generalised version of the modified EDC model without the need for an assumed, single-step chemical reaction or ad hoc coefficient tuning. The results show good agreement with experimental measurements of two CH4/H2 flames in hot coflows, showing improvements over the standard EDC model as well as the previously published modified EDC model. The updated version of the EDC model also demonstrates the capacity to reproduce the downstream transition in flame structure of a MILD jet flame seen experimentally, but which has previously proven challenging to capture computationally.

In this paper, the newly-proposed shadow position mixing model (SPMM) is examined, using a DNS database for a temporally evolving di-methyl ether slot jet flame. Two methods that invoke different levels of approximation are proposed to extract the shadow displacement (equivalent to shadow position) from the DNS database. An approach for a priori analysis of the mixing-model performance is developed. The shadow displacement is highly correlated with both mixture fraction and velocity, and the peak correlation coefficient of the shadow displacement and mixture fraction is higher than that of the shadow displacement and velocity. This suggests that the composition-space localness is reasonably well enforced by the model, with appropriate choices of model constants. The conditional diffusion of mixture fraction and major species from DNS and from SPMM are then compared, using mixing rates that are derived by matching the mixture fraction scalar dissipation rates. Good qualitative agreement is found, for the prediction of the locations of zero and maximum/minimum conditional diffusion locations for mixture fraction and individual species. Similar comparisons are performed for DNS and the IECM (interaction by exchange with the conditional mean) model. The agreement between SPMM and DNS is better than that between IECM and DNS, in terms of conditional diffusion iso-contour similarities and global normalized residual levels. It is found that a suitable value for the model constant c that controls the mixing frequency can be derived using the local normalized scalar variance, and that the model constant a controls the localness of the model. A higher-Reynolds-number test case is anticipated to be more appropriate to evaluate the mixing models, and stand-alone transported PDF simulations are required to more fully enforce localness and to assess model performance.", "key_words": ["Mixing models", "Probability density function methods", "Direct numerical simulation", "Turbulent nonpremixed flames"], "affil": [{"affilname": "Cornell University College of Engineering", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "University of Connecticut", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "Sandia National Laboratories, California", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "Pennsylvania State University", "contry": "United States"}], "citedby_count": "6"}

The washed samples did not exhibit the LDH reconstruction property but showed a high specific area and low basicity. The metal used in the reconstruction influences the crystallinity, basicity, and reducibility of the materials. Samples with Zn showed higher crystallinity and reducibility, whereas the samples with Mg showed higher basicity. Among all the catalysts, reconstruction with Zn and subsequent washing leads to the best results with CH4 and CO2 conversion of 73% and 90%, respectively, and an H2/CO ratio of approximately 2.

The explosive system studied is an ideal gas with a single exothermic reaction governed by a pressure-dependent reaction rate (pn ) with a pressure exponent of n =3. A pressure-dependent reaction rate, rather than the usual exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of Arrhenius kinetics, is used so that the detonation wave is not affected by the extreme temperature sensitivity associated with Arrhenius kinetics and can be modelled with simple, analytical techniques, and thus the effect of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified. The two-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas with the same thermodynamic properties as the explosive. The heterogeneity is introduced into the explosive via a large-amplitude, two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in density in the initialization of the simulation, while maintaining a constant pressure. The computational simulations are initialized with a ZND solution for the ideal CJ detonation, and the detonation is allowed to propagate into the explosive layer. The simulations show that the detonation in the heterogeneous medium exhibits a cellular-like structure of complex shock interactions. The detonation is able to propagate into a significantly thinner layer of explosive and can exhibit a greater velocity than the corresponding homogeneous case. A parametric study of varying the wavelength of the sinusoid shows the existence of an optimal size of heterogeneity at which the effect is the greatest corresponding to a wavelength that is approximately 10 to 50times the half reaction zone length of the ideal CJ detonation. As the wavelength is decreased to the size of the reaction zone length, the behavior reverts back to the homogeneous case.

This study aims at investigating benefits and impacts of smart logics applied to outdoor cooling, by field testing a web of nebulizers coupled to a bespoke fuzzy controller piloting the pump. The cooling action was tweaked as convenient to maintain comfortable conditions and to avoid energy wastage whenever unneeded. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first application of fuzzy logic to water spraying systems (or to any other controllable urban climate mitigation technology) targeting comfort and energy optimization. The prototype was field monitored in comparison with the conventional on-off control, in two Italian urban contexts (Cfa and Csa climatic zones) over 15 days in the hottest months of the year. The cooling and humidification action was thoroughly characterized by mapping both the horizontal and vertical profiles and by applying advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to spot the main environmental drivers. The maximum cooling (measured between the sprayed area and an undisturbed reference) touched 7.5 °C and 6.14 °C in the two locations, respectively. The energy saving achieved under fuzzy control versus the temporized control, was spectacularly high in the wetter and windier location with an average of −51.2% and a maximum of −67.5%. The comfort benefit was also substantial: the temperature never deviated from neutrality by more than ±2 °C, whereas with the on–off, this threshold was surpassed between the 14% and the 20% of the time by even more than 5 °C. The results suggest that smartly controlled nebulization is an energy-efficient and comfort-effective strategy to counteract urban overheating.

Ionization signals were obtained by collecting the electric charge with two thin iridium probes which were immersed into the flame. Relative ionization signals were measured as a function of dc probe voltage, laser tuning, Na-solution concentration, and free-O2 concentration. Fluorescence signals served to monitor the relative populations of the higher Na levels. A preliminary qualitative interpretation is given on the basis of collisional ionization from the saturated as well as the higher levels, which are mutually connected by population redistribution. With the assumption of a quasi-steady-state ionization, an effective Saha equation is derived, which connects the concentration of the atoms in the saturated level with the ionic concentration by an effective ionization constant. Values of this constant were estimated from the experiments and compared for the different excitation modi investigated. Additional one-photon wing excitation of the 3P–5S transition might play a role as an intermediate step in the ion production when the 3P level is saturated. The presence of excess O2 molecules enhances the degree of ionization, whereas the addition of comparable quantities of N2 molecules does not have this effect. This is explained by the positive electron affinity of O2, which shifts the effective ionization equilibrium. The role of multiphoton processes which directly transfer Na atoms from the 3S or 3P state to the continuum state is shown to be negligible.

At sufficiently high temperatures and sufficiently low gas flow rates, both the reduction and oxidation steps become limited only by the flow of gas across the material and not by material kinetic factors. In this contribution, we develop a numerical model describing fuel production rates in this gas-phase limited regime. The implications of this behavior are explored under all possible isothermal pressure-swing cycling conditions, and the outcome is optimized in terms of fuel production rate as well as fuel conversion and utilization of input gas of all types. Fuel production rate is maximized at infinitesimally small cycle times and attains a value that is independent of material thermodynamics. Gas utilization is maximized at infinitesimally small gas inputs, but the values can be made independent of cycle time, depending on manipulation of flow conditions.

The working pair “adsorbent – adsorbate” is a key factor affecting the performance of AHT cycle. This paper addresses the investigation of the adsorption of methanol vapor on MIL-101(Cr), which belongs to a family of porous crystalline solids, Metal – Organic Frameworks. MIL-101(Cr) is shaped with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binder to form grains. The equilibrium of methanol adsorption on the grains of MIL-101(Cr) is studied and the potential of the MIL-101(Cr) – methanol working pair is estimated for various AHT cycles. The dynamics of methanol adsorption is explored under conditions of a new cycle for upgrading temperature of ambient heat. The main findings of this study are: (i) the addition of PVA does not affect methanol adsorption equilibrium; (ii) the amount of methanol exchanged under typical conditions of the cooling and ambient heat amplification cycles varies from 0.27 to 0.31 g/g; (iii) under conditions of the heat amplification cycle the methanol adsorption on the loose grains of 0.8–1.8 mm size, occurs under the “grain size insensitive mode” when the dynamics of adsorption in the adsorbent beds with the same thickness does not depend on the size of MIL grains. For the desorption runs, the poor mass transfer decelerates the process for the grains of 1.6–1.8 mm size; (iv) the specific useful heat and heating power for heat amplification cycle equal 385 kJ/kg and 0.65–1.95 kW/kg, respectively.

Today, it is not clear what the extent of these effects could be at multiple spatial scales including building sectors, cities, and climate zones. More importantly, the uncertainty of mathematical models used to estimate these effects is not well understood. This knowledge gap makes it difficult to evaluate decisions about what buildings, cities, and even technologies should be prioritized in the race to mitigate climate change. Moreover, this lack of knowledge makes it difficult for researchers to build on the limitations of past models effectively. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a novel framework for quantifying model uncertainty in the context of climate change and building energy consumption. The framework blends for the first time large sources of weather and building energy consumption data with Bayesian statistics and first-principle building energy models. The framework is used to forecast the potential effects of climate change in buildings across 96 cities in the United States for the 21st century. Based on our estimates and credible intervals, we found reasons to support the idea that commercial buildings in hot/warm and humid climates should be at the top of the agenda of climate action in the building sector of the United States.

Directly produced at the refueling stations site, hydrogen greenhouse gas emissions are presently defined to be zero in e.g. the Directives of the European Union since emissions arising from the facilities construction are defined to be negligible. In order to check the validity of this assumption with respect to the latest technical developments in hydrogen supply, the present article aims to report the environmental performance of hydrogen being produced and compressed for mobility purposes. To this end, a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with an on-site alkaline electrolyser is assessed, which was built and operated in Berlin.

These expenditures generate a significant footprint in the specific e.g. greenhouse gas emissions if the electrolyser is operated at a reduced load factor as it may be foreseen for grid stabilisation purposes. To ensure a strong reduction of emissions compared to conventional fuels, this load factor should be sufficiently high and should be defined to not fall under a certain threshold in upcoming directives.

Production of bio-ethanol from biomass is one way to reduce both consumption of crude oil and environmental pollution. Using bio-ethanol blended gasoline fuel for automobiles can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust greenhouse gas emission. Bio-ethanol can be produced from different kinds of raw materials. These raw materials are classified into three categories of agricultural raw materials: simple sugars, starch and lignocellulose. Bio-ethanol from sugar cane, produced under the proper conditions, is essentially a clean fuel and has several clear advantages over petroleum-derived gasoline in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality in metropolitan areas.

To promote the aviation electrification process, it is necessary to develop an efficient energy storage system and a stable power transmission system to improve the reliability and extend the endurance of electric aircraft. This paper designs a novel propulsion system topology and power distribution algorithm for light manned electric aircraft. Firstly, a novel aircraft hybrid propulsion system topology is designed, in which the battery energy storage system can work synergistically with the fuel cell to provide power to the aircraft electric engine. Then, an adaptive energy management framework is developed to distribute the aircraft power requirement between energy storage devices. Meanwhile, an aircraft power balance state recognizer is designed to enhance the dynamic performance of the aircraft and adjust the working state of the propulsion system. The proposed hybrid propulsion system configuration and power distribution algorithm are verified under a prototype two-seater electric aircraft: Alpha Electro. Numerical analysis results indicate that the developed methods can dynamically meet the power requirement of aircraft under fast-charging and peak power requirement scenarios. With the developed hybrid propulsion system, most of the fuel cell high-power working points are moved to the medium and low area, which indicates that the fuel cell is effectively protected.

Moreover, a significantly higher adsorption resistance of the electrode with completely degraded ionomer was observed, indicating the adsorption site of the intermediates, i.e., the electrochemical surface area of Pt on the electrode without Nafion is lower than that of the electrode packed with the powder mixture of Pt/C and Nafion.\n               ", "key_words": ["Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "Hydrogen oxidation reaction", "Porous microelectrode", "Ionomer degradation modeling"]}

The relative yield of CH3 and CH2Cl depends on the excess of methane.\n                  In the CH4, system consumption of C2 species to ultimately form benzene is shown to proceed by a stepwise addition of CH3 radicals to C\n                        n\n                     H\n                        m\n                      species.

Because of the high fusion temperatures of the ashes investigated, deposition on a time scale practical for the pilot scale experiments was observed only at furnace exit gas temperatures above 1700 K (2600°F), higher than the temperatures expected in the convective section of a boiler.

The growth of the flame is evaluated from OH*-chemiluminescence and schlieren visualisation, which combined with OH/fuel planar laser-induced fluorescence visualisation reveal details of the propagation mechanisms. The aviation fuels investigated – Jet A and a renewable alternative, ATJ-8 – exhibited similar flame speed behaviour due to changes in SMD in each of the propagation modes identified: the droplet, inter-droplet, and gaseous-like modes. Concentrated reactions around large droplets found in lean conditions (ϕ = 0.8) allowed for a slowly propagating flame front which, in turn, ignited new droplets. Stoichiometric to rich conditions (ϕ = 1, 1.4) were marked by stronger evaporation ahead of the flame and, therefore, higher and more uniform heat release across the flame. Still, droplets penetrated the flame, locally inducing regions of negative flame curvature and continuing to evaporate in the burnt products. The droplet-induced effects disappeared at low SMD (16 µm, ϕ = 1.4), giving rise to a fully gaseous layer ahead of the flame and the highest flame speeds.

Among all the hydrogen carriers, methanol has become one of the research focuses due to its high H/C ratio, flexibility and sustainability. Regarded as the core of hydrogen supply system, catalysts with higher activity, selectivity and stability are continuously developed for improved efficiency. In this review, two groups of catalysts were investigated namely copper-based and group VIII metal-based catalysts. Not only macro indicators such as feedstock conversion and product selectivity, but also micro interaction and reaction mechanism were elaborated, with respect to the effects of promoters, supports, synthesis methods and binary metal components. Notably, several reaction pathways and catalysts deactivation mechanisms were suggested based on this series of inspection of the structure-reactivity relationship, along with a general perception that large surface area, well dispersed metals, small particle size and synergy effects significantly improve the catalytic performance. Accordingly, a novel concept of single-atom catalysts (SACs) was introduced aimed at efficient hydrogen production under more moderate conditions, by combining the advantages of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Additionally, an efficient reforming process is required by properly regulating the feed flow and heat flow through a coupled system.

In this review, a comprehensive attempt has been made to revisit the main updates, advantages and disadvantages surveyed in recent research (2012–2017) on fermentative hydrogen production from a variety of biomass. The main findings of this review are now stated. The biological hydrogen production processes consist of indirect and direct biophotolysis, dark fermentation, two-stage fermentation and photo-fermentation. To maximize hydrogen gas yield via such technique, the activity of hydrogen-consuming bacteria should be inhibited at the acetate and hydrogen formation stage to stop or reduce hydrogen consumption. The major constraints in biological hydrogen production processes are raw material cost, low hydrogen evolution rate and yield at large scale. Lignocellulosic materials generate low yield of hydrogen gas due to the presence of refractory lignin while food waste containing carbohydrates and starch yields more hydrogen gas. Effective pretreatment of substrates and inoculum can enhance hydrogen yield. In dark fermentation process, better performance can be obtained with pretreatment. Nitrogen sources such as yeast result in higher biohydrogen generation rate and cell growth from the presence of amino acids and proteins. In photo-fermentation, better results can be obtained by using a combination of photosynthetic bacteria and green microalgae, as it enhanced solar energy utilization. Future development such as genetic manipulation could be employed, which mainly focuses on the disruptive characteristics of endogenous genes. The efficiency of biohydrogen production can also be increased by lowering the costs of delivery, production, conversion, storage and practical applications. Apart from using biodegradable wastes, green wastes will be the mostly preferable targeted feedstock for hydrogen fermentation because of their large quantity and having simultaneous waste treatment benefit.\n               ", "key_words": ["Anaerobic digestion", "Biohydrogen", "Biological processes", "Biomass", "Fermentation"]}

The steam turbine gross power is equal to 600MW, and both the live and reheated steam parameters are equal to 600°C/29MPa and 620°C/5MPa, respectively. With the assumed constant gross power of the analyzed plant, the thermal efficiency of the boiler and the power requirements of the equipment used in the above mentioned installations were calculated. These values and also the net efficiency of the analyzed plant were determined as a function of the oxygen recovery rate in the membrane (R). The net efficiency is lower by 7.26 percentage points in comparison with the reference system. The basic method to reduce the loss of net efficiency is to introduce an integrated system, both with a boiler and an ASU installation lignite drying system. This allowed for the reduction of the loss of net efficiency of up to 3.9 percentage points for the lignite dried to w =20% and 3.3 percentage points at w =10%. Increase in the intensity of the drying of the lignite not only causes an increase in the maximum system efficiency but also reduces the required membrane surface.

Once the thermodynamic model is established the properties of the gases present in the cycle must be evaluated and the simplifications made for this evaluation could lead to inaccurate and even misleading results. In this paper the effect of using the perfect gas model in the optimization of the Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) of the open simple cycle gas turbine has been analyzed. The results are obtained for compressor and turbine inlet temperatures (CIT and TIT) between 260 K–320 K and 1200 K–1800 K respectively. The optimization yields the minimum of SFC but also the corresponding values of compressor pressure ratio and specific power. In this work the optimization is first performed with a highly accurate ideal gas modeling approach in order to generate benchmark results. Afterward, the optimization is performed with a perfect gas modeling approach using four different methods (named A, B, C and D) to evaluate the constant value needed of the isobaric heat capacity. It is found that the optimization results can depend strongly on the method or rule used to evaluate the heat capacity. As an example, the uncertainty in the optimal value of SFC is between 8.5% and 14.9% with method C and below 3.2% with method D. In general, huge deviations in the compressor pressure ratio are found. Values higher than 16% for CIT below 300 K regardless the TIT value are found with methods A, B and C. In the worst case this deviation can be even higher than 100%. In general, this uncertainty gives rise to higher deviations in the specific power than in optimal SFC values. For example, with the method B and a TIT of 1800 K the ranges of the relative error are 56%–112%, 4.9%–6.2% and 17.8%–26.7% in the compressor pressure ratio, optimal SFC and specific power respectively.

A vast monitoring campaign is undertaken, involving the installation of the sensing instruments and the data acquisition and reduction system. All the relevant parameters were continuously recorded and conveniently averaged over 1 h intervals. For the first year of operation, the agreement between experimental results and theoretical calculations (on an hourly basis) is promising for the days tested.

These reactions give a shortcut during the important fuel consumption phase in combustion processes leading from H-atom abstraction directly to the β-scission products without fuel radical thermalization. Methyl formate (MF) was shown to be prone to hot β-scission due to a low β-scission barrier height. Furthermore, MF as smallest methyl ester can be considered as biodiesel surrogate and it is an important intermediate product during combustion of various ethers. In this work a predominantly ab-initio derived detailed kinetic model of MF combustion is developed including hot β-scission pathways and compared to a sophisticated literature model based on classical estimation methods. For this, new stoichiometric MF in air ignition delay time measurements in a shock tube and a rapid compression machine over a wide temperature range (790 K–1250 K) and pressures of 10, 20 and 40 bar served as validation targets. The experimental ignition delay times (IDT) show Arrhenius type behavior in both facilities at all conditions. The newly developed quantum-based model catches the pressure dependency and low-temperature reactivity well although overpredicting the IDT at higher temperatures. It was found that hot β-scission is the major depletion pathway of formate group-centered MF radicals. This, however, does not change the overall reactivity of MF combustion due to the low stability of the alkyl peroxide (RO2) at the formate group. For species with competing thermal β-scission and RO2 formation, however, hot β-scission may have a significant impact.", "key_words": ["Methyl formate", "Hot beta scissions", "Ab-initio", "Kinetic modeling", "Ignition delay times"], "affil": [{"affilname": "Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen", "contry": "Germany"}, {"affilname": "Helsingin Yliopisto", "contry": "Finland"}], "citedby_count": "6"}

Moreover, biomass has a high energy-generation potential, produces less toxic emissions than some other fuels, is mostly carbon neutrality, and burns easily. Biomass has been widely utilized as a raw material in thermal chemical conversion, replacing coal and oil, including power generation. Biomass firing and co-firing in pulverized coal boilers, fluidized bed boilers, and grate furnaces or stokerfed boilers have been developed around the world because of the worsening environmental problems and developing energy crisis. However, many issues hinder the efficient and clean utilization of biomass in energy applications. They include preparation, firing and co-firing, and ash-related issues during and after combustion. In particular, ash-related issues, including alkali-induced slagging, silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), agglomeration, corrosion, and ash utilization, are among the most challenging problems. The current review provides a summary of knowledge and research developments concerning these ash-related issues. It also gives an in-depth analysis and discussion on the formation mechanisms, urgent requirements, and potential countermeasures including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, and alloying.\n                  Alkali species, particularly alkali chlorides and sulfates, cause alkali-induced slagging during biomass combustion. Thus, the mechanisms of generation, transformation, and sequestration of alkali species and the formation and growth of alkali-induced slagging, formed as an alternating overlapping multi-layered structure, are discussed in detail. For silicate melt-induced slagging (ash fusion), the evolutions of chemical composition of both the elements and minerals in the ash during combustion and existing problems in testing are overviewed. Pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 are proposed as effective tools to predict ash fusion characteristics and the properties of melt-induced slagging. Concerning agglomeration that typically occurs in fluidized bed furnaces, melt-induced and coating-induced agglomeration and coating-forming mechanisms are highlighted. Concerning corrosion, seven corrosion mechanisms associated with Cl2, gaseous, solid/deposited, and molten alkali chlorides, molten alkali sulfates and carbonates, and the sulfation/silication of alkali chlorides are comprehensively reviewed. The effects of alloying, salt state (solid, molten, or gaseous), combustion atmosphere, and temperature are also discussed systematically. For ash utilization, potential approaches to the use of fly ash, bottom ash, and biomass/coal co-fired ash as construction and agricultural materials are explored.\n                  Several criteria or evaluation indexes are introduced for alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration, and chemical equilibrium calculation and multicomponent phase diagrams of silicate melt-induced slagging and agglomeration. Meanwhile, remedies, including the use of additives, co-firing, leaching, alloying, and the establishment of regulations, are discussed.\n                  It is suggested that considerable attention should be focused on an understanding of the kinetics of alkali chemistry, which is essential for the transformation and sequestration of alkali species. A combination of heterogeneous chemical kinetics and multiphase equilibrium modeling is critical to estimating the speciation, saturation levels, and the presence of melt of the ash-forming matter. Further practical evaluation and improvement of the existing criterion numbers of alkali-induced slagging and agglomeration should be improved. The pseudo-4D phase diagrams of (Ma2O)-MaeO-P2O5-Al2O3 and (Ma2O)-MaeO-SiO2-Al2O3 should be constructed from the data derived from real biomass ashes rather than those of simulated ashes in order to provide the capability to predict the properties of silicate melt-induced slagging.

In order to compose a model which allows predicting the onset of thermo-acoustic instability of combustion in a practical appliance, one has to characterize the thermo-acoustic properties of the burner including the flame as an acoustically active element and acoustic properties of all other (usually passive) components of the combustion appliance both upstream as well as downstream of the burner. This kind of modeling strategy usually faces serious practical problems related to the need of measurements/modeling at the hot downstream part of the system. In the present work, we propose a measurement and a system modeling approach which relies on two acoustic measurements, namely reflection coefficients, only at the cold (burner upstream) part of the combustion appliance. Both reflection coefficients, termed upstream and input, can be readily measured using standard acoustic techniques. The need to measure the input reflection coefficient of an acoustically active subsystem may impose difficulties related to the acoustic instability of the measurement setup itself. The approach and technical solution to handle this problem via a special modification of the excitation source (loudspeaker box) is proposed. The dispersion relation to search for system eigen frequencies is represented in a form that couples the reflection coefficients of the upstream part of the appliance and input reflection coefficient from the downstream part as observed through the burner with flame. This form of the dispersion relation is commonly used in the theory of radio-frequency circuits and recently introduced for thermo-acoustic problems. The proposed method is applied to burners with premixed burner-stabilized Bunsen-type flames. The observed instability conditions and oscillation frequencies are compared with predictions of the proposed modeling approach and reveal good correspondence.", "key_words": ["Combustion instability", "Reflection coefficient measurement", "Dispersion relation", "Acoustic diode"]}

It was found that hydrogen yield, calculated as a mass percentage of biomass processed, was highest for chars produced from hemp seeds, tobacco stalk, corn cobs and coffee husk and lowest for apple pomace and sugar cane. A relationship has been derived between char yield and production of hydrogen, especially in the case of hemp seeds. Consequently, a trend was discovered (R2 = 0.90) when comparing the ash free char yield with the carbon content of the feedstock, which is useful to estimate char yields on an ash free basis if the carbon content is known. An inverse relationship was observed, for tobacco stalk, between the quantity of hydrogen produced and its purity, represented as a mole percentage of hydrogen in the gas stream, for the three different steam reforming temperatures (650, 675 & 700 °C). The residence time investigation showed that decreasing the vapour residence time, reduced both hydrogen production and purity, possibly as a result of the water gas shift reaction.\n               ", "key_words": ["Hydrogen", "Pyrolysis", "Steam reforming", "Lumber and agricultural residues", "Biomass"]}

In addition, the distributed nature of the biomass resource and its normally low energy density may result in large transportation costs. Biomass also requires large land areas to collect and process the incoming solar radiation before the energy can be harvested. Previously published works on regional energy clustering (REC) and the Regional Resources Management Composite Curve, RRMCC (in this paper shortened to RMC), have been extended in this paper to tackle simultaneously the issues of the biomass supply chain, transportation, and land use. The RMC is a tool for supporting decision making in regional resource management. It provides a complete view of energy and land availability in a region, displaying their trade-offs in a single plot. The extension presented in this work has been developed in two steps. The first step presents the Regional Energy Cascade Analysis, which estimates the energy target within regional supply chains and provides the result for energy exchange flows between zones, the quantity of energy required to be imported/exported, and the locations of the demands. In the second step, the initial results are analysed against potential measures for improving the energy and land use targets by using the RMC and a set of rules for its manipulation. The presented method provides the option to assess the priorities: either to produce and sell the surplus energy on the fuel market or use the land for other purposes such as food production. This extended approach is illustrated with a comprehensive case study demonstrating that with the RMC application it is possible to maximise the land use and to maximise the biofuel production for the requested energy demand.", "key_words": ["Renewables", "Regional energy clustering", "Biomass supply chain", "Regional Energy Cascade Analysis", "Resource planning", "Carbon footprint minimisation"], "scp_id": "78049413574"}

The technique proposed would depend on the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid by cooling to −78.5°C. The overall density is approximately one and a half times ∼ 1.56 kg.dm−3 that of seawater. If the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate quite deeply into soft underlying sediments. This conclusion is based on in-situ investigations using penetrators that were studied as a disposal option for other solid wastes. This concept should, therefore, provide permanent storage as the emplaced carbon dioxide will be chemically sequestered by the sediments (via the formation of an intermediate clathrate). Other than secure segregation of the emplaced CO2, the penetrator option has a further major advantage in that there should be no long-term effects to biological systems: penetrator disposal is deep within sedimentary formations which have zero or very low biological activity.", "key_words": null, "scp_id": "0005027043", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "17"}

A description is given here of experimental work concerning the rates of formation of product species and heat release in a turbulent, buoyant natural gas diffusion flame burning in this two-layered configuration.

Measurements of the composition of these gases allowed the computation of stoichiometries and heat release rates. These investigations showed that the species produced in the flame depend primarily on the stoichiometry of the gases present in the ceiling layer and weakly on the temperature of the layer, but are independent of the fuel-air ratio of the mass transported into the layer by the plume.

An integrated model is developed for the integrated SPT system including the heliostat field, the molten salt solar receiver, the molten salt thermal storage, and the S-CO2 recompression Brayton cycle with reheating. Parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of some key thermodynamic parameters (e.g. hot salt temperature, cycle high pressure, cycle low pressure, intermediate pressure, and the split ratio) on the integrated SPT system in terms of exergy efficiency. The parameter optimization is performed by using genetic algorithm in order to obtain the highest overall exergy efficiency. The effects of the component performance and the compressor inlet temperature on the optimum parameters are also discussed. The results indicate that the optimum hot salt temperature is 565°C which is its maximum allowable temperature when the solar salt is used as the heat transfer fluid and the thermal storage media. Besides, the optimum cycle low pressure is in the range of 7.80–10.0MPa which means that the cycle low pressure is not mandatory to be close to the critical pressure. The increase in the compressor inlet temperature leads to both the decrease in maximum exergy efficiency and the variation of the optimum thermodynamic parameters. The component performances have significant effects on the maximum exergy efficiency, but slight effects on optimum thermodynamic parameters. A novel salt with a higher maximum allowable temperature is indispensable for further improving the system efficiency.

Therefore, improving the surface properties is one of the main ways to enhance heat transfer. In this study the heating coatings were prepared by boiling deposition using GNP nanofluids, GNP/Ag mixed nanofluids, and GNP-Ag hybrid nanofluids with different mass fractions (wt% = 0.001,0.002,0.003) as raw materials. The boiling heat transfer characteristics of DI water on the bare copper surface and heating coatings were studied, and the heat transfer mechanism was analyzed. The results show that GNP-Ag hybrid nanoparticle coating has the most outstanding enhanced heat transfer effect. DI water achieves the highest critical heat flux (CHF) of 163.65 W/cm2 and heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of 9.69 W/cm2K on the coating, which are respectively 45.84% and 82.14% higher than the smooth copper surface. The wettability was analyzed by measuring the contact angle. Scanning electron microscope image was used to analyze the microstructure of the coating. The microstructure of Ag modified functionalized GNP nanoparticle has a great change compared with mixed nanoparticles. It was observed that the hybrid nanoparticle deposit into a large number of bulges and cavies, and the bulges accumulate in clusters and form self-assembled flower-shaped bulges. Combined with the energy spectrum test results of the heating coating, the coverage of the nanoparticles in the coating on the copper substrate and the variation trend of each deposited element with the concentration are analyzed. The novel heating coating enhances heat transfer under the combined action of nanoparticle functional groups, coating microstructure, and wettability. GNP-Ag hybrid nanoparticle coating was applied towards the heat dissipation of electronic devices.

Parametric studies using a Eulerian formulation are carried out for monodisperse n-dodecane counterflow spray flames, in order to analyze the sensitivity of the flame structure to strain rate and droplet diameter over a wide range of equivalence ratios. These results reveal complex and multi-modal spray-flame structures that exhibit collocated, distributed, and cool flames.

The impact of low-temperature chemistry on the distributed flame is not pronounced. For low strain-rate conditions, the presence of a weak cool flame without high-temperature reaction zones is reported.

Modifications to turbulent diffusion theory to incorporate these effects are challenging since the theory is Lagrangian. In this article, we present an alternate Eulerian framework based on the surface density formalism. We employ the proposed framework to analyze a database of direct numerical simulations of spherical turbulent premixed flames in decaying isotropic turbulence and recover mechanisms for which scaling laws are proposed and assessed against data. We characterize quantitatively two mechanisms: one related to the mean velocity gradient induced by thermal expansion and the other due to flame propagation in the presence of curvature. We demonstrate that the net effect of these two processes is to hinder the growth of the turbulent flame brush in the present configuration.

Chemical fuels may be produced efficiently via electrocatalytic water splitting, which uses electric and solar power. The development of efficient anodic electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a greater concern of present energy research. Cerium oxide (CeO2) are promising electrocatalysts that exhibit outstanding OER but their reduced stability obstructs the practical application. A novel strategy was established to construct an effective catalyst of heteroatom (N, B, P and S) doped CeO2 matrix were prepared. Moreover, the doping of heteroatoms into the CeO2 matrix processes the improved electronic conductivity, reactive sites, increases the electrochemical catalytic activity, which enhances the water oxidation reaction. Consequently, well-suited alkaline electrolysers were brought together for water oxidation to ideal OER electrocatalytic activity. The OER activity of the electrocatalysts follows the order of S–CeO2 (190 mV@10 mA cm−2), N– CeO2 (220 mV @10 mA cm−2), P– CeO2 (230 mV @10 mA cm−2), B–CeO2 (250 mV @10 mA cm−2) and CeO2 (260 mV @10 mA cm−2) in 1 M of KOH.

This review article deals with the application characteristics of DME in CI engines, including its fuel properties, spray and atomization characteristics, combustion performance, and exhaust emission characteristics. We also discuss the various technological problems associated with its application in actual engine systems and describe the field test results of developed DME-fueled vehicles. Combustion of DME fuel is associated with low NO x , HC, and CO emissions. In addition, PM emission of DME combustion is very low due to its molecular structure. Moreover, DME has superior atomization and vaporization characteristics than conventional diesel. A high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate can be used in a DME engine to reduce NO x emission without any increase in soot emission, because DME combustion is essentially soot-free. To decrease NO x emission, engine after-treatment devices, such as lean NO x traps (LNTs), urea-selective catalytic reduction, and the combination of EGR and catalyst have been applied. To use DME fuel in automotive vehicles, injector design, fuel feed pump, and the high-pressure injection pump have to be modified, combustion system components, including sealing materials, have to be rigorously designed. To use DME fuel in the diesel vehicles, more research is required to enhance its calorific value and engine durability due to the low lubricity of DME, and methods to reduce NO x emission are also required.", "key_words": ["Dimethyl-ether (DME)", "Compression ignition (CI) diesel engine", "Ground transportation vehicle fueled with DME", "Alternative fuel", "Emission reduction", "Thermodynamic properties of DME"]}

However, a Singly Truncated from below Normal Weibull mixture distribution (TNW-pdf) and a two component mixture Weibull distribution (WW-pdf) developed here do provide very good fits for both unimodal and bimodal wind speed frequency distributions observed in that region and offer less relative errors in determining the annual mean wind power density.

The number and size distributions of the dispersed phase have a significant effect on both the long-term stability of the emulsion and the probability of micro-explosion inside an engine. Although the elevated pressures, temperatures, and shear found in high-pressure pumps and common-rail injector nozzles are likely to alter the properties of emulsions, the effect of these engine components on the injected emulsion are not known. To address this issue we sampled an emulsion at several locations within the injection system, from the fuel tank to the injector nozzle, and measured the evolution of the droplet size distribution of the emulsion’s dispersed phase. We varied the water mass fraction (5, 10 and 15% by volume) of the emulsion and the injection pressure (500, 1000 and 1500 bar), imaged the samples using a high-resolution microscope and extracted the droplet size distribution using a purpose-built image processing algorithm. Our measurements reveal that the dispersed droplet sizes reduce significantly after the emulsion is compressed by the high-pressure fuel pump, and again after being injected through the nozzle’s orifices. Additionally, the dispersed droplet sizes measured from the pump’s return and injector return to the fuel tank were also smaller than the initial size, suggesting that the physical and calorific properties of the emulsion in the fuel tank can change significantly with time. Hence we propose that differences in injection equipment and engine testing duration may contribute to some of the disagreements in the literature regarding the effect of emulsified fuels on engine emissions and fuel efficiency. The engine performance and energy efficiency of vehicle fleets that use emulsified fuels will vary with engine running time, thus potentially inducing a drift in the engine performance and exhaust emissions. This investigation also suggests that, in order to be representative of actual injection conditions, fundamental studies of the micro-explosion of emulsion droplets should be performed using much smaller dispersed droplet sizes than those normally found in an unused emulsion.", "key_words": ["Water-in-diesel", "Macro-emulsions", "Nano-emulsions", "Micro-explosion"], "scp_id": "85045757143"}

In this paper we propose a new approach to solar hydrogen production with the integration of methanol steam reforming and middle-temperature solar thermal energy. An experiment on hydrogen production is conducted using a 5-kW solar reactor at 150−300°C under atmosphere pressure. The 5-kW solar receiver/reactor is fabricated and positioned along the focal line of one-tracking parabolic trough concentrator. As a result, the chemical conversion of methanol can reach levels higher than 90%, and the volumetric concentration of hydrogen in the gas products can account for 66−74% above the solar flux of 580W/m2. The obtained maximum hydrogen yield per mole of methanol is 2.65−2.90mol, approaching the theoretical maximum value, and the experimentally obtained thermochemical efficiency of solar thermal energy converted into chemical energy is in the range of 30−50%, which is competitive with other high-temperature solar thermochemical processes.

The results show that the highest yield of liquid tar reaches up to approximate 38 wt% (38 g/100 g raw coal) at 350 °C, and that SCCO2 can promote the liquid tar yield by 5.6 wt% compared to that using pure ethanol due to the synergistic effect between ethanol and SCCO2.

Two polygeneration applications based on gasification technology are considered in this paper: (1) a biorefinery plant co-producing synthetic natural gas (SNG) and district heat; (2) a combined heat and power (CHP) plant using integrated gasification combined cycle technology. Using an optimisation model we identify the levels of policy support, here assumed to be in the form of tradable certificates, required to make biofuel production competitive to biomass based electricity generation under various energy market conditions. Similarly, the tradable green electricity certificate levels necessary to make gasification based electricity generation competitive to conventional steam cycle technology, are identified. The results show that in order for investment in the SNG biorefinery to be competitive to investment in electricity production in the DH system, biofuel certificates in the range of 24–42 EUR/MWh are needed. Electricity certificates are not a prerequisite for investment in gasification based CHP to be competitive to investment in conventional steam cycle CHP, given sufficiently high electricity prices. While the required biofuel policy support is relatively insensitive to variations in capital cost, the required electricity certificates show high sensitivity to variations in investment costs.

This work quantifies the costs, climate impacts, and physical characteristics of three technology pathways for fuel production onboard aircraft carriers: alkaline electrolysis and reverse water gas shift (AE + RWGS); solid oxide electrolysis and RWGS (SOEC + RWGS); and co-electrolysis of steam and CO2. Two design scenarios are evaluated: a small, infrequently operating plant using excess nuclear power (Scenario A); and a large, frequently operating plant with dedicated nuclear capacity (Scenario B). Fuel production costs are quantified using a Monte Carlo techno-economic analysis, ranging from 1.91 to 4.49 and 3.25–4.23 $/L in Scenarios A and B, respectively. The lowest cost technology pathway is AE + RWGS. All technology pathways are shown to offer reductions in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of 82–86% relative to petroleum JP-5. In Scenario B, the plant volume and weight are estimated at 50–67% and 432% of current aircraft carrier designs, respectively, highlighting challenges for technical feasibility. Furthermore, increasing plant production capacity and capacity factor is shown to reduce the unit cost of fuel production, but that this is largely offset by the additional costs of dedicated nuclear capacity required at larger scales. The results indicate that fuel production on an aircraft carrier may be technically feasible, cost competitive, and environmentally beneficial relative to the petroleum fuels currently in use. However, research to further reduce system cost, weight, and volume, including experimental validation, are still required.", "key_words": ["Power-to-Liquids", "Electrofuels", "JP-5", "Fischer-Tropsch", "Co-electrolysis", "Techno-economic analysis"], "scp_id": "85072555489"}

The engine was developed for novel application in a small, free piston engine for decentralized power generation. Operation occurred at wide-open-throttle at a speed of 5400 RPM for both port injection (PI) and low-pressure direct injection (LPDI). In both cases, the electronic ignition timing was adjusted for maximum brake torque, while the fuel was adjusted such that both rich and lean combustion were examined. The LPDI engine was then operated over a variety of engine speeds. An energy balance was completed for both PI and LPDI operation, which quantified all energy pathways, as engine operating regimes changed. Results showed that exhaust chemical energy (ECE) for LPDI was reduced significantly when compared to PI, mostly due to less fuel slip. The fuel slip rate ranged from 35 to 40% for PI operation while it was in the range of 6–20% for LPDI operation. However, mixture stratification with LPDI operation increased carbon monoxide emissions. The start-of-injection (SOI) was also examined, targeting a SOI to provide the highest trapping efficiency and most stable combustion. For LPDI operation, trapping efficiency, which is function of engine speed, showed significant effects on overall efficiency and fuel slip. Air volumetric efficiency increased due to the absence of gaseous fuel within the intake manifold. It was shown that, relative to PI, the overall engine indicated efficiency increased by 90% to a maximum indicated efficiency of 30% for LPDI operation with a SOI of 180 CAD BTDC.", "key_words": ["PI", "LPDI", "Natural gas", "Two-stroke", "SI"], "scp_id": "85053360918"}

Reaction times and temperatures are adjusted using various delivery methods: bulk, addition funnel, and metering pump. It is found that the transition metal catalysts typically used to generate hydrogen gas are poisoned by seawater. B2O3 is not poisoned by seawater; in fact, reaction times are considerably faster in seawater using B2O3. Reaction times and temperatures are compared for pure water and seawater for each delivery method. It is found that using B2O3 with pure water, bulk addition is 97% complete in 3 min; pump metering provides a convenient method to extend the time to 27 min, a factor of 9 increase above bulk addition. Using B2O3 with seawater as a reactant, bulk addition is 97% complete in 1.35 min; pump metering extends the time to 23 min, a factor of 17 increase above bulk. A second acid accelerator, sodium bisulfate or NaHSO4, is investigated here for use with NaBH4 in seawater. Because it is non-reactive in seawater, i.e., no spontaneous H2 generation, NaHSO4 can be stored as a solution in seawater; because of its large solubility, it is ready to be metered into NaBH4. With NaHSO4 in seawater, pump metering increases the time to 97% completion from 3.4 min to 21 min. Metering allows the instantaneous flow rate of H2, and reaction times and temperatures, to be tailored to a particular application. In one application, the seawater hydrogen generator characterized here is ideal for supplying H2 gas directly to Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells in sea surface or subsea environments where a reliable source of power is needed.", "key_words": ["Seawater", "Hydrogen generation", "Metering", "Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell", "Sea surface or subsea"]}

Therefore, it is important that it fully recognizes which policy, or combination of policies, promoting solar PV applications has the greatest economic benefit. This study uses the system dynamics approach to develop a simulation for assessing these promotion policies. Using this simulation system, policymakers can carry out cost/benefit analyses for different combinations of promotion policies, CO2 emission reduction goals, and budget limitations. In addition, the simulation scenarios include different FIT prices, subsidies, and upper limits of annual ROI (return of investment). The simulation period is from 2011 to 2030. We find that when adopting only FITs or capital subsidies with a fixed upper limit of ROI, increasing the FIT price or subsidy is a good approach. When the upper limit of ROI is fixed, the effect of different combinations of FIT prices and subsidies on the accumulation of solar PV applications is insignificant.

In this paper, a relatively new technique is proposed for the GHGs of gases using a warm plasma reactor. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have been identified as the most significant GHGs arising from anthropogenic activities, affecting the climatic global change. The technique here used is the so called Dry Reforming, assisted by a warm plasma reactor, including the reactants treatment, synthesis gas generation, and finally the syngas production (H2 + CO). The gases CO2 and CH4 are relatively stable compounds with low potential energies. The dry reforming is an endothermic reaction and external energy must be provided in order to achieve the targets inquired. More recently, plasma gas reforming is emphasized as promising technique for energy saving and environment safe purposes with increasing demand of hydrogen and synthesis gas production. In the case of plasma reforming, high electron energy provides not only radical species, but also the enthalpy required for endothermic reaction. The conversion of hydrocarbon in by-products with high added value is mainly contributed by dissociation and ionization processes. With respect to other techniques of hydrocarbons reforming by plasma discharges, there are enough references related to RF plasma discharges operating at reduced pressures, even if these low pressure plasma could achieve high hydrocarbon conversion and good H2 selectivity; the low H2 production rate and extra energy requirement for vacuum device constrain its practical use, therefore an alternative procedure and system consisting in a novel plasma reactor is here proposed. Warm plasma is environment-friendly and auto-sustainable processes, besides the electric discharge has low specific energy requirement still maintaining enough high temperature (1000–3000 K) to produce excited species, supporting subsequent chemical reactions. Such plasma discharges have significant advantages: Do not require extra cooling systems, since they work with reduced electric current flows and high voltages, avoiding electrodes erosion. Consequently, reactors can be achieved with a simpler outline and high capacity gas treatment.\n               ", "key_words": ["Plasma reforming", "Greenhouse gas", "Synthesis gas"]}

Aiming at the power demand of the underwater observation system, this paper presents a novel distributed ocean current energy hydrostatic transmission (HST) power generation solution, which can generate electricity efficiently and continuously in large depth and low flow velocity environment. The proposed solution adopts a dual-pump confluence design. According to this, the working pressure of the HST is reduced to avoid overflow compared to the single pump design, and therefore the dispersed micro-energy in deep-sea can be aggregated together to convert continuously to active power rather than to the heat. Furthermore, the solution employs an energy-saving strategy involving constant pressure pump and seawater cooling and improves effectively the efficiency to some extent. Besides, it was found that the working pressure of the system depends not only on load torques but also on turbine speeds reversely, while the speed of hydraulic variable displacement motor maintains constant. Therefore, dual-pump confluence implies power aggregation and plays a key role in generating electricity in deep-sea. Simulation results and the tests based on the 5 kW prototype verifies the feasibility of the proposed distributed HST solution.

Many studies in the literature address the topic but mostly considering only a couple of urban and non-urban stations. In this paper, the urban climate in Rome, Italy, is analysed after monitoring of the air temperature and relative humidity in four selected neighbourhoods and one reference station from October 2014 until September 2017. Rome is characterised by a composite urban pattern and high variability of building types, of which the four selected areas are representative.

The UHI is more intense in summer than in winter (average increase between 0.7 °C and 1 °C); while the diurnal and nocturnal UHI depends on the season and the neighbourhood. Then, the energy performance of a representative apartment block and a typical office building was computed using the measured data. Regarding the predicted energy performance, comparing the four urban sites and the reference site, the UHI causes a reduction of heating consumption up to 21% in residential building and 18% in the office building.

Aside from the aforementioned uncertainties, the dispatch of the integrated electric-gas system suffers from two inherent obstacles, which are model nonconvexities, originating from the Weymouth equations in the gas network, and the demand-side differentiated gas delivery priorities according to current industrial practice, respectively. To deal with the conundrum, an adjustable robust dispatch method is proposed for operating the integrated electric-gas system, where uncertain wind generation outputs and gas loads are described by intervals. In contrast to existing work employing pre-determined intervals, the admissible wind output intervals in this paper are optimized, reflecting the interdependencies between the regulation capabilities of gas-fired generation and the gas delivery adequacy. By this means, gas delivery priority is considered in comply with gas industrial practice, and it also provides a more flexible mechanism to maintain robustness of the dispatch strategy. Through analyzing the feasibility impact of uncertain variables, a deterministic robust counterpart is derived, in which uncertainties are eliminated based on affine generator dispatch and estimation of total line pack. Furthermore, nonconvex quadratic terms in the Weymouth equations are expressed as difference-of-convex functions. A sequential convex optimization procedure is developed, and a heuristic method is suggested to initiate the sequential algorithm. The proposed models and methods are tested on three test systems. Key impact factors on the dispatch strategy, such as gas prices, wind generation forecast accuracy and gas network initial operation conditions, are analyzed, and the computational benefits brought by convex programming are validated by scalability tests.", "key_words": ["Integrated electric-gas system", "Robust dispatch", "Adjustable robustness", "Linear decision rule", "Convex optimization", "Gas delivery priority"], "scp_id": "85060764076"}

The combustor burns CH4/H2 mixtures at atmospheric pressure and temperature for a fixed Reynolds number of 20,000 and fixed swirl angle. For both cases, essentially four different flame shapes are observed, with the transition between flame shapes occurring at the same equivalence ratio (for the same fuel mixture) irrespective of whether the combustor is acoustically coupled or uncoupled. The transition equivalence ratio depends on the fuel mixture. For the baseline case of pure methane, the combustor is stable close to the blowoff limit and the average flame in this case is stabilized inside the inner recirculation zone. As the equivalence ratio is raised, the combustor transitions to periodic oscillations at a critical equivalence ratio of ϕ = 0.65 . If hydrogen is added to the mixture, the same transition occurs at lower equivalence ratios. For all cases that we investigated, flame shapes captured using chemiluminescence imaging show that the transition to harmonic oscillations in the acoustically coupled cases is preceded by the appearance of the flame in the outer recirculation zone. We examine the mechanism associated with the transition of the flame between different shapes and, ultimately, the propagation of the flame into the outer recirculation zone as the equivalence ratio is raised.

Many recent studies have investigated 100% renewable energy generation scenarios, but few have explored the trade-offs associated with an electricity grid dominated by non-synchronous generation (i.e. wind and solar). Fast frequency response from grid-forming inverters—along with other technology changes—could help mitigate low system inertia levels, but the impact of this response is unknown. An inertia-constrained unit commitment and dispatch model was used to study the stability of future grid scenarios with high penetrations of non-synchronous renewable energy generation under a variety of technology scenarios. The Texas grid (the Electric Reliability Council of Texas – ERCOT) was used as a test case and instances when the system inertia fell below 100 GW · s (the grid’s current minimum level) were recorded. When the modeled critical inertia limit was reduced to 80 GW · s to represent changes in grid operation, no critical inertia hours occurred for renewable energy penetrations up to 93% of annual energy. The critical inertia limit could drop to 60 GW · s if the largest generators in ERCOT (two co-located nuclear plants) were retired, but emissions increased by ~ 25% in these scenarios. If the critical inertia limit was kept the same (100 GW · s), adding 525 MW of fast frequency response from wind, solar, and energy storage could reduce the number of critical inertia hours by up to 95%. These results show that changes to grid operating practices and generator retirements reduced critical inertia hours more than fast frequency response from inverter-connected resources.

In addition, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and soot emission were reduced. BSFC was lower at swirl rate of 1 than that at swirl rate of 0, with a reduction in the range of 1.1–2.01g/(kWh)−1. For KL factor at 12°CA ATDC, it was also observed that at 12°CA ATDC, the KL factor was lower at swirl rate of 1 than that at swirl rate of 0, with a reduction of 34.9%. Related numerical research on split injections with swirl was performed, and the results show that at a specific swirl, the main injection deviated from the pilot injection and entered the area between two sprays, enhancing the utilization of air in the chamber. In addition, the main combustion process accelerated due to the better thermal-atmosphere provided by the pilot injection, so that a better engine performance and lower soot concentration was achieved.", "key_words": ["Split injection", "Swirl rate", "KL factor", "Flame temperature", "Diesel engine"], "scp_id": "84991585123", "affil": [{"affilname": "Beijing Institute of Technology", "contry": "China"}, {"affilname": "China North Engine Research Institute", "contry": "China"}, {"affilname": "Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd.", "contry": "China"}], "citedby_count": "39"}

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the methods reported to enhance each step involved in anaerobic digestion. More important, enzymes are the key to anaerobic digestion, and the strategies for improving enzyme activity are summarized. As electron transfer has been reported to play an important role in anaerobic digestion, the research progress of the approaches for the acceleration of direct interspecies electron transfer in methane production is also introduced.

This is not only to meet the political aspirations for increased demand-side flexibility that now exist in many corners of the world, but to make sure that users are charged for the costs they incur. As it is only until recently that this type of users have come to face demand charges, there are however very few studies on what the actual effects of such pricing policies are, and those studies that do exist suffer from different methodological shortcomings that reduce their validity as a basis for real-world policy evaluations. This study provides the first state-of-the-art causal analysis of the demand response effects of a billing demand charge involuntarily introduced to small and medium sized users (35–63 A), using novel two-level time series models on retrospective observational consumption and survey data. Our analyses suggest that the tariff has induced an average response of −0.32 kWh/h per user over a two year long posttreatment period in comparison to a matched control group, equal to 7.4% of their hourly average use during the pretreatment period. The response seems to have increased over time and to be greater during wintertime: around −0.70 kWh/h or 16.2% of the treated users’ average hourly use during the pretreatment period. Comparing the individual users’ response to the size of their financial incentive to respond given the new tariff as well as their self-reported perception of the relative importance of electricity expenditures, we did not find any support for the common assumption that users with a higher financial incentive to respond do so to a greater extent. This might suggest that small and medium-sized commercial users, just as residential users, may exhibit non-financial drivers and barriers for engaging in demand response that may be vital to understand as policy makers and industry continue to seek increased demand-side flexibility.", "key_words": ["Demand response", "Demand-based", "Capacity charge", "Capacity-based", "Causal inference"], "scp_id": "85059962510"}

However, increasing the Zr content did not automatically lead to the highest amount of hydrogen produced during cycling. Indeed, the powder with 25% Zr produced 334 and 298 μmol H2/g at 1050 °C during the first and the second cycle, respectively. In contrast, the powder with 50% Zr yielded 468 and 266 μmol H2/g during the two successive cycles. Moderate Zr contents thus favored H2 production during repeated cycles without any significant reactivity losses. A kinetic study of the reduction and the hydrolysis steps was proposed. The activation energies for the thermal reduction and the hydrolysis of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 were 221 kJ/mol and 51 kJ/mol, respectively.

The characteristics of EIEs make them potentially ideal for coordinating with power systems and gaining a win–win situation, especially when the renewable energy penetration rate is high. However, problems still remain as to how to organize this coordination. In this paper, we design a decomposed coordinative scheduling (DCS) approach in which independent EIEs and the system exchange information iteratively to achieve final settlements. Based on a general modeling of EIEs, we introduce a mathematical formulation for DCS. The corresponding algorithm is also provided. We compare DCS to other scheduling approaches in case studies.

Calcined carbonate materials, such as limestone or dolomite, can be used directly in the fluidised bed of the gasification reactor to reform tars in situ and to enhance carbon conversion and cold gas efficiency of the gasification process. However, they exhibit poorer mechanical stability, they tend to be attrited and carried over from the reactor, and their catalytic activity decreases over time. Therefore, a portion of the material has to be replenished continuously or periodically. To decrease the amount of carbonate material that has to be replenished, a lower amount of lime (calcined limestone or dolomite) can be used in the FB, diluted by a mechanically robust material, such as silica sand or olivine. According to the literature, even concentrations in the order of 10–35% wt. of carbonate material in the FB of silica sand have a substantial effect on the decomposition of tars during steam or air gasification. However, the effect of the concentration of lime in the FB has not yet been described for CO2 gasification. In this paper, we focus on the effect of the ratio of calcined dolomitic limestone and silica sand in the FB (0%, 25%, 50% and 100% vol. of dolomitic limestone) for CO2+O2 gasification of biomass and compare it with H2O+O2 gasification at the temperature of 850 °C. The experiments were performed in a semi-autothermal spouting FB reactor, gasifying 1.4 kg h−1 of woody biomass. The effects of the concentration of dolomitic lime in the fluidised bed differed for H2O+O2 and CO2+O2 gasification. When gasifying with H2O+O2, optimal results were found with 50% vol. (35% wt.) lime in the FB, when the yield of tar was similar to the use of pure lime in the FB. When gasifying with CO2+O2, a substantial decrease in tar yield was observed when using 50% vol. (35% wt.) lime in the FB (compared to the use of pure silica sand); nevertheless, the use of undiluted lime in the FB remains the best option to attain minimal tar yield when gasifying with a CO2+O2 gasifying agent. In this case, the tar yield was decreased 8.7-fold, and the tar dew point was decreased by 124 °C (to 71 °C) compared to the non-catalysed case with silica sand being the fluidised bed of the gasifier.", "key_words": ["Tar", "Biomass", "Reforming", "Limestone", "Dolomite", "CO2"], "scp_id": "85042856984"}

This is the starting assumption of the present study, in which structures of near-limit steady sphericosymmetrical flame balls are investigated with the objective of providing analytic expressions for critical combustion conditions in ultra-lean hydrogen-oxygen mixtures diluted with N2 and water vapor. If attention were restricted to planar premixed flames, then the lean-limit mole fraction of H2 would be found to be roughly ten percent, more than twice the observed flammability limits, thereby emphasizing the relevance of the flame-ball phenomena. Numerical integrations using detailed models for chemistry and radiation show that a one-step chemical-kinetic reduced mechanism based on steady-state assumptions for all chemical intermediates, together with a simple, optically thin approximation for water-vapor radiation, can be used to compute near-limit fuel-lean flame balls with excellent accuracy. The previously developed one-step reaction rate includes a crossover temperature that determines in the first approximation a chemical-kinetic lean limit below which combustion cannot occur, with critical conditions achieved when the diffusion-controlled radiation-free peak temperature, computed with account taken of hydrogen Soret diffusion, is equal to the crossover temperature. First-order corrections are found by activation-energy asymptotics in a solution that involves a near-field radiation-free zone surrounding a spherical flame sheet, together with a far-field radiation-conduction balance for the temperature profile. Different scalings are found depending on whether or not the surrounding atmosphere contains water vapor, leading to different analytic expressions for the critical conditions for flame-ball existence, which give results in very good agreement with those obtained by detailed numerical computations.

The oil shale deposit in sedimentary strata with hidden layering, and the kerogen in oil shale is dispersed in flat strips that ranges from a few to tens of microns in size. A large amount of micro-scale pores and fractures are formed along the bedding in oil shale during the in-situ pyrolysis process, which creates connected channels and enhances the effectiveness of thermal fluid injection and the yield of pyrolysis products. Back to 2005, Zhao’s team invented the oil shale in-situ retorting technology by injecting superheated steam, and related technical advantages are analyzed in detail.

The problem considers clusters for daily curve patterns and a day-ahead electric curve forecast from previous electric load and pattern history. We propose a model called the logistic mixture vector autoregressive model (LMVAR) that combines both clustering and forecasting in a single model through the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm.

Despite the fact that several researchers have used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology as a tool to estimate the environmental impact of TES systems, there is no unanimity in the scientific community on the environmental evaluation method to be used.

The results were used to identify the best cases, considering the environmental benefits that they generate.

Specific emphasis is on determining the effects of various extents of recycled flue gas cleanup on soot and ash aerosol formation characteristics.

As the hydrogen blending ratio increased from 0% to 70%, the total exergy loss decreased by 2%. Specifically, the exergy loss from heat conduction decreased, primarily due to the decreased flame thickness. Moreover, the reactions with H2, H and H2O as reactants were inhibited, leading to decreased the exergy loss from chemical reactions. As pressure increased from 1 atm to 5 atm, the total exergy loss decreased by 1%, because the exergy losses induced by heat conduction and chemical reactions decreased as the flame thickness was reduced. The exergy loss from incomplete combustion also decreased, because elevated pressure inhibited dissociations and decreased the mole fractions of incomplete combustion products.\n               ", "key_words": ["Exergy loss", "Laminar premixed flame", "Methane", "Hydrogen", "Chemical kinetics"]}

A key phenomenon is serious wind curtailment, where potential clean wind power is abandoned and the associated environmental and climate benefits could not be fulfilled. Multiple causes have been identified to explain the serious wind curtailment in China; but few studies provide explanations for the patterns of wind curtailment and quantify the relative contributions of the underlying factors. We develop a flexible analytical framework and adapted the logarithmic mean Divisia index method to quantify the contributions of key factors in the change of wind curtailment rate. While the early stage of wind curtailment was constrained by limited transmission capacity, recent wind curtailment is primarily driven by the deceleration of the overall economic growth, which resulted in a slowdown of electricity demand and low willingness-to-accept imported power across provinces. The current economic transition has induced an oversupply of power in general and wind power in particular, especially in wind rich provinces. This seems to be hindering further energy transition. With greater political will and better policy design, the oversupply of power could be an opportunity to speed up substitution of coal with wind and to expedite the de-carbonization of the economy.", "key_words": ["Wind curtailment", "Logarithmic mean Divisia index", "Economic new normal", "Transmission constraints"], "scp_id": "85042869264"}

The benefits of the model are its simplicity and high computational efficiency for practical use in investigating the diurnal urban air temperature change and its asymmetry in a city with both naturally-ventilated (NV) and air-conditioned (AC) buildings. Our model predicts a lower urban heat island and higher urban cool island intensity in a city with naturally-ventilated buildings than for a city with air-conditioned buildings. During the urban densification (from a low-rise, low-density city to a high-rise, high-density one), the increases in the time constant and internal heat gain give rise to asymmetric warming phenomena, which become more obvious in a city with air-conditioned buildings rather than naturally-ventilated ones. Unlike previous studies, we found that a low-rise, low-density city experiences a stronger urban cool island effect than a high-rise, high-density city due to less heat being emitted into the urban atmosphere.

The economic outlook of potential installations can be addressed by hybridizing GSHP systems with an auxiliary system. To better understand optimization factors in sizing hybrid GSHP systems, a series of sensitivity analyses have been performed. Using a rigorous mathematical, computational approach to size hybrid GSHP systems recently published in Alavy et al. (2013), the use of sensitivity analyses has allowed for a better determination of the impact that variations in input parameters have on the performance of GSHPs. A total of five analyses were performed to determine the effects that operating costs, inflation, geographical location within North America, and a seasonality control strategy have on sizing hybrid GSHP systems. The effects inflation of natural gas and/or electricity prices have depends on a building’s energy demands. An inflation (deflation) in electricity rates makes hybrid GSHP systems for very cooling (heating) dominant buildings more economical compared to conventional systems. Installations of smaller GSHP systems are more economical when considering time-of-use electricity rates compared to fixed electricity rates, for buildings with long operating hours during off-peak periods. However, downsizing the ground loop system causes an increase in annual operating costs which result in longer payback periods. Similarly, if a building is situated in a location with warmer weather where ground temperatures are thus higher, an optimally designed system will tend to have a shorter ground loop length. By meeting less of the building’s peak energy demands (hybrid shave factor) substantially reduces the initial costs of the ground-loop installation.", "key_words": ["Ground-source heat pumps", "Geothermal", "Hybrid ground-source heat pumps", "Sensitivity analysis"], "scp_id": "84908119755"}

As shipping faces the challenge of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and cutting its carbon emissions this paper seeks to explore the potential for harnessing wind power for shipping. Numerical models of two wind power technologies, a Flettner rotor and a towing kite, are linked with wind data along a set of five trade routes. Wind-generated thrust and propulsive power are computed as a function of local wind and ship velocity. The average wind power contribution on a given route ranges between 193kW and 373kW for a single Flettner rotor and between 127kW and 461kW for the towing kite. The variability of the power output from the Flettner rotor is shown to be smaller than that from the towing kite while, due to the different dependencies on wind speed and direction, the average power contribution from a Flettner rotor is higher than that from the kite on some routes and lower on others. While for most forms of international cargo shipping wind may not be suitable as the sole source of propulsive energy, a comparison of average output to main engine power requirements of typical vessels serving the routes indicates that it could deliver a significant share. For instance, installing three Flettner rotors on a 5500dwt general cargo carrier could, on average, provide more than half of the power required by the main engine under typical slow steaming conditions. Uncertainties and simplifying assumptions underlying the model analysis are discussed and implications of the results are considered in light of the urgent need for decarbonisation.

Sooting diffusion flames formed by a small pool combustion equipment system were used for this purpose. Benzene and hexane were used as typical aromatic and paraffin fuels. A laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) method was used to obtain spatial distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are considered as soot particles. Spatial distributions of soot in test flames were measured by a laser-induced incandescence (LII) method. Soot diameter was estimated from the temporal change of LII intensity. A region of transition from PAHs to soot was defined from the results of LIF and LII. Flame temperatures, PAH species, and soot diameters in this transition region were investigated for both benzene and hexane flames. The results show that though the flame structures of benzene and hexane were different, the temperature in the PAHs–soot transition region of the benzene flame was similar to that of the hexane flame. Furthermore, the relationship between the PAH concentrations measured by gas chromatography in both flames and the PAH distributions obtained from LIF are discussed. It was found that PAHs with smaller molecular mass, such as benzene and toluene, remained in both the PAHs–soot transition and sooting regions, and it is thought that molecules heavier than pyrene are the leading candidates for soot precursor formation.\n               ", "key_words": ["Laminar diffusion flame", "Liquid fuel", "Laser-induced fluorescence", "Particle size measurement", "Soot precursor", "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons", "Gas chromatography"], "scp_id": "47849120981"}

However, it is still not competitive enough to conventional vehicles because of the limited driving range and the high cost of the battery. Therefore, the energy efficiency is of the most importance for the control of EVs. Existing range extension control systems on EVs mostly focus on longitudinal front and rear axle torque distribution or lower-level yaw moment allocation. It is a challenge to maintain the vehicle’s stability at the cost of the minimum energy when the vehicle is cornering, this paper proposes a phase plane-based controller for EVs, focusing on the energy-efficient upper-level yaw stability control. The phase plane-based controller is automatically adaptive to driving situations through the optimization of weights on the performance of the vehicle handling and stability. Firstly, a friction constrained desired model is presented for the model-following control. Secondly, β - β ̇ phase plane analysis is conducted based on a nonlinear vehicle model to graphically identify the vehicle lateral stability in real time. The self-stable region can be determined by the vehicle velocity, the road friction coefficient, and the wheel steering angle. Then, energy optimizing (i.e. gain scheduling of LQR controllers) rules are designed based on the vehicle lateral stability identification. Finally, the proposed phase plane-based controller is evaluated and the yaw moment costs are compared to other controllers’ in a realistic 7-DOF vehicle model. The results demonstrate that the proposed controller presents an excellent yaw stability control capability, and compared to the widely used Shino’s controller, the proposed controller reduces the energy consumption by 9.68% and 3% at the ‘light’ and ‘severe’ maneuver, respectively.", "key_words": ["Energy-efficient", "Vehicle stability control", "Gain scheduling", "Phase plane", "Nonlinear system", "Linear quadratic regulator (LQR)"], "scp_id": "85041542194"}

The novel LHS unit includes shell and tube with longitudinal fins based heat exchanger and paraffin as thermal energy storage material. The experimental investigations are focused on identifying the transient temperature performance, effective mode of heat transfer, accumulative thermal energy discharge and mean discharge power of paraffin in LHS unit. Moreover, the influences of operating conditions such as the inlet temperature and volume flow rate of heat transfer fluid (HTF) on thermal behaviour of LHS unit are experimentally studied. The transient temperature profiles and photographic characterisation of liquid-solid transition of paraffin in LHS unit provide a good understanding of temperature distribution and dominant mode of heat transfer. It is noticed that during discharging cycles, natural convection has an insignificant impact on thermal performance of LHS unit. However, due to inclusion of extended longitudinal fins, conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer. It is noticed that due to the development of solidified paraffin around tubes and longitudinal fins, the overall thermal resistance is increased and thus, discharging rate is affected. However, by regulating the inlet temperature or volume flow rate of HTF, the influence of overall thermal resistance is minimised. Mean discharge power is enhanced by 36.05% as the inlet temperature is reduced from 15 °C to 5 °C. Likewise, the mean discharge power is improved by 49.75% as the volume flow rate is increased from 1.5 l/min to 3 l/min. Similarly, with an increase in volume flow rate, the discharge time of equal amount of thermal energy 12.09 MJ is reduced by 24%. It is established that by adjusting operating conditions, the required demand of output temperature and mean discharge power can be attained. Furthermore, this novel LHS unit can meet large scale thermal energy demands by connecting several units in parallel and thus, it has potential to be employed in wide-ranging domestic and commercial applications.", "key_words": ["Thermal energy storage", "Latent heat storage", "Discharge cycle", "Phase change materials", "Heat transfer", "Shell and tube heat exchanger"], "scp_id": "85033602229", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "49"}

In this study, a tube-like one-dimensional constant volume bomb, which simplifies the geometry of a real engine's combustion chamber near top dead center, was used to better understand the fundamental phenomenon underlying super knock. H2/O2 mixture was used to maintain reaction intensity even at lower pressure than that in real highly boosted engines. Simultaneous high speed shadowgraphy and pressure measurement were conducted to study the effects of initial pressure and temperature on combustion mode and flame propagation. By comparing the frequencies of super knock pressure oscillation in the boosted engine and after-detonation pressure wave in the constant volume bomb, a relation can be found between the super knock and detonation. The experimental results also show that the detonation tendency of H2/O2 mixture in the constant volume bomb increases with increasing initial pressure but decreases with increasing initial temperature, indicating that the mixture density i.e. energy density plays an important role in detonation onset.\n               ", "key_words": ["Super knock", "One-dimensional constant volume bomb", "H2/O2\n                  ", "Detonation"]}

The accurate estimation of the conversion efficiency of such devices using simple yet effective numerical tools is a necessity to optimize their performance. This work presents an in-house code, which is based on the Drift Diffusion Model to simulate p-n junction diodes, under equilibrium (bias voltage application) and non-equilibrium (bias voltage and device illumination) conditions. Under non-equilibrium, illumination can originate from either solar radiation (conventional photovoltaic cell) or a thermally heated emitter (thermophotovoltaic operation). The drift-diffusion and Poisson’s equations are solved using a one-dimensional (1D) finite element Petrov-Galerkin method based on piecewise nonlinear interpolants of second-order accuracy, while the total current is evaluated in a post-process manner using the Scharfetter-Gummel scheme. Initially, the model is verified against the freeware SimWindows. Later on, a parametric analysis on the photovoltaic cell design and operating conditions reveals that its efficiency is highly affected by its total length, the n-type sub-region width, the doping levels of both p and n regions, the semiconductor material type, and, the device’s operating temperature. In contrast to other solvers, this one takes into account the model parameters’ dependence on temperature and electromagnetic spectrum, while it can be extended to incorporate the thermally stimulated electron emission in thermionic-based devices and 2D spatial effects. Finally, the calculated conversion efficiencies can be used to build a Reduced Order Model that can be further coupled with a computational fluid dynamics model to evaluate the overall thermo-electric performance of a solid-state device.", "key_words": ["1D model", "Drift Diffusion Model", "Numerical simulation", "PN junction", "TPV converter"], "scp_id": "85099192048", "affil": [{"affilname": "Center For Research And Technology - Hellas", "contry": "Greece"}, {"affilname": "Istituto Di Struttura Della Materia, Montellibreti", "contry": "Italy"}, {"affilname": "National Technical University of Athens", "contry": "Greece"}], "citedby_count": "0"}

Hydrogen is also being employed for formulating fuels such as hydrogen compressed natural gas in the gaseous form and hydrogenated biofuels in the liquid form. The present study evaluates (i) hydrogen usage on the fuel formulation and (ii) investigates the engine operation of an automotive turbocharged diesel engine operated with karanja biodiesel blended diesel (B20) as a reference fuel. Existing literature outlines that biodiesel blends possess lower energy content and emit higher nitric oxide (NO) emission than fossil diesel. The present research paper partially hydrogenates karanja biodiesel using an autoclave reactor with a palladium catalyst to increase the saturation levels and mitigate the biodiesel-NO penalty. Besides, the drop in energy release of B20 is compensated through the provision of hydrogen induction along the intake manifold. The hydrogen flow rates to the turbocharged engine are maintained at a fixed energy share of 10%.

Coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) are considered as the major anthropogenic mercury emission source to the atmosphere, especially for China, India, and the US. Studies on mercury in coal combustion process have been carried out for decades, which include content and occurrence forms of mercury in coal, mercury transformation during coal combustion, sampling, co-removal and emission of mercury in CFPPs, mercury removal technologies for CFPPs. This current review summarizes the knowledge and research developments concerning these mercury-related issues, and hopes to provide a comprehensive understanding of mercury in coal combustion process and guidance for future mercury research directions.\n                  The average mercury content in the coal from China, the US, and South Africa is 0.20, 0.17, and 0.20 mg/kg, respectively, which is higher than the world's coal average value of 0.1 mg/kg. In general, mercury in coal is in the forms of sulfide-bound mercury (mainly pyritic mercury, dominant), clay-bound mercury, and organic matter-bound mercury, which are influenced by diagenetic, coalification, and post-diagenetic conditions, etc. Mercury transformation in coal combustion includes homogeneous (without fly ash) and heterogeneous (with fly ash) reaction. The transformation is affected by the coal types, flue gas components, flue gas temperature, combustion atmosphere, coal ash properties, etc. The effects of chlorine, NOx, SO2, H2O, O2 NH3 on elemental mercury (Hg0) homogeneous oxidation and the influence of physical structure properties, unburned carbon, and metal oxides in fly ash as well as flue gas components on Hg0 heterogeneous transformation are systematically reviewed in detail. For the mercury transformation in oxy-coal combustion, O2 promotes Hg0 oxidation with Cl2 while NO and CO2 inhibit or do not favor that reaction. CO2 increases Hg0 oxidation in the atmosphere of NO and N2. SO2 will limit Hg0 oxidation, while HCl has a higher oxidation effect on Hg0 than that in air-coal combustion atmosphere. Fly ash plays an important role in Hg0 oxidation. SO3 inhibits mercury retention by fly ash while H2O promotes the oxidation.\n                  The sampling or analysis principle, sampling requirements, and advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used on-site mercury sampling methods, namely, Ontarion Hydro Method (OHM), US EPA Method 30B, and Hg-CEMS, are compared. The air pollution control devices (APCDs) in CFPPs also have the mercury co-removal ability besides the conventional pollutants, such as NOx, particulate matter (PM), SO2, and fine PM. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment, electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fabric filter (FF), and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) device are good at Hg0 oxidation, particulate mercury (Hgp) removal, and oxidized mercury (Hg2+) capture, respectively. The Hg0 oxidation rate for SCR equipment, and the total mercury (Hgt, Hgt = Hg0 + Hg2+ + Hgp) removal rate for ESP, FF, and WFGD device is 6.5–79.9%, 11.5–90.4%, 28.5–90%, and 3.9–72%, respectively. Wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) can capture Hg0, Hg2+, and Hgp simultaneously. The mercury transformation process in SCR, ESP, FF, WFGD, and WESP is also discussed. Hgt removal in ESP+WFGD, SCR+ESP+WFGD, SCR+ESP+FF+WFGD, and SCR+ESP+WFGD+WESP is 35.5–84%, 43.8–94.9%, 58.78–73.32%, and 56.59–89.07%, respectively. The mercury emission concentration in the reviewed CFPPs of China, South Korea, Poland, the Netherlands, and the US is 0.29–16.3 µg/m3. Mercury in some fly ash and gypsum, and in most WFGD and WESP wastewater, is higher than the relevant limits, which needs to be paid attention to during their processing.\n                  Mercury removal technologies for CFPPs can be divided into pre-combustion (including coal washing technology and mild pyrolysis method), in-combustion (including low-NOx combustion technology, circulating fluidized bed combustion technology, and halogens addition into coal), and post-combustion (including existing commercial SCR catalyst improvement, inhibiting Hg0 re-emission in WFGD, mercury oxidizing catalysts, injecting oxidizing chemicals, carbon-based adsorbents, fly ash, calcium-based adsorbents, and mineral adsorbents) based on the mercury removal position. The mercury removal effects, mercury removal mechanism, and/or influencing factors are summarized in detail. One of the regenerable mercury removal adsorbents, the magnetic adsorbent modified by metal oxides or the metal halides, is the most promising sorbent for mercury removal from CFPPs. It has advantages of high mercury removal efficiency, low investment, easy separation from fly ash, and mercury recovery, etc. Lastly, further works about mercury transformation in coal combustion atmosphere, mercury co-removal by APCDs, the emission in CFPPs, and mercury removal technologies for CFPPs are noted.\n               ", "key_words": ["Mercury", "Coal", "Content and forms", "Transformation", "Coal-fired power plants", "Emission and removal"], "scp_id": "85062680213", "affil": [{"affilname": "University of Alberta", "contry": "Canada"}, {"affilname": "Southeast University", "contry": "China"}], "citedby_count": "133"}

A vaned Savonius wind turbine is one of the possible solutions, which can fulfil the requirements of being simultaneously reliable, safe and non-disturbing. One challenge is that when the size of the turbine becomes smaller and the wind velocity is low, the Reynolds number effects begin to deteriorate the performance. Public literature lacks detailed information about how the turbine performance and internal flows change in these conditions. In this work, a vaned Savonius turbine is tested in a wind tunnel with seven Reynolds numbers and several tip-to-speed ratios. The measurements include both the turbine performance and the static pressures inside the vane passages. All experiments are also conducted separately for the stator only configuration to evaluate the effects of stator-rotor interaction. The main results are: (1) a new Reynolds number-dependent performance prediction correlation is developed with an achievable accuracy of ± 5%, (2) Savonius turbine power coefficient follows the trend of kinetic compressors relatively well and due to the changing Reynolds number, an over 20% drop in vaned turbine performance can be observed, (3) the Reynolds number affects performance through friction and flow separations, but the vane passage pressure distributions are not affected and (4) tip-to-speed ratio affects the vane passage pressure distribution via stator-rotor interaction. It is also suggested that the nominal tip-to-speed ratio should be kept relatively low in the design phase to minimise the negative effects of stator-rotor interaction.", "key_words": ["Savonius rotor", "Wind turbine", "Renewable energy", "Reynolds number", "Off-design"], "scp_id": "85065533866"}

A simulation software, so-called Virtual Engine Model (VEMOD), is employed in this study to build and analyze the proposed oxy-fuel engine model which is calibrated with experimental data. The engine and its auxiliary components (turbochargers and heat exchangers) are assessed under oxy-fuel combustion conditions for the engine full load operation points from 1250 rpm to 3500 rpm. If compared to a conventional CIE, at high engine speeds the proposed oxy-fuel combustion engine provides similar brake power and indicated efficiency, whereas at low engine speeds, despite of it yields higher brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC on average, more than 10%), a brake power enhancement (on average, more than 30%) is observed. In any way the breakthrough result is the feasible end of correlation between BSFC and CO2 emissions due to CO2 capture.", "key_words": ["Oxy-fuel combustion", "Internal combustion engine", "Membrane", "MIEC", "Energy recovery", "Carbon capture"], "scp_id": "85114983102", "affil": null, "citedby_count": "0"}

The paper proposed an in-situ approach for measuring sodium (Na) release in coal combustion by Flame Emission Spectroscopy (FES). Through the analysis of spontaneous emission spectra and a calibration procedure, the concentration of gas phase Na, temperature and thermal radiation can be obtained. Firstly, experimental measurement of Zhundong coal particles burning in a flat flame burner was done. Two kinds of Zhundong coal with similar proximate and ultimate analyses, but different ash composition were used. The Na-release history measured by FES was compared with that by LIBS. Results showed that the Na-release at the devolatilization, char, and ash stages can be distinguished by FES. The higher Si/Al content in ash can suppress the Na-release at the ash stage. Moreover, FES method was extended to the measurement of Na-release in four industrial boiler furnaces of two Zhundong coal-fired power plants. Results showed the Na-release measured by FES can reflect the change of fuel and load, and both temperature and thermal radiation play key roles in Na-release in coal combustion.", "key_words": ["Coal combustion", "Sodium release", "Flame emission spectroscopy", "Temperature", "Thermal radiation"], "affil": [{"affilname": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "contry": "China"}, {"affilname": "Shenhua Guoshen Technical Research Institute", "contry": "China"}], "citedby_count": "2"}

In this scenario, the anaerobic digestion of vinasse (the most abundant effluent from a sugarcane biorefinery) arises as an interesting alternative because, in addition to promoting the stabilization of organic matter, it also enables energy generation from biogas. In this work, vinasse anaerobic digestion in biorefineries was evaluated in terms of energy, environmental, and economic considerations. The energy potential from vinasse of a single sugarcane biorefinery, which is generally lost due to its application to soil with no treatment, was found to be comparable to the electricity supply demand of a city of approximately 130,000 inhabitants or to the surplus energy from bagasse burning that is exported by some sugarcane mills in Brazil. On a national level, such energy is comparable to the electricity generated by some hydroelectric plants, reaching 7.5% of the electricity generated by the world’s largest hydroelectric plant. When burned in boilers, biogas could be used to stimulate second-generation ethanol production because almost 12% of the bagasse could be released from burning and the biogas used to attenuate the process energy demand. As an alternative fuel, biogas could replace up to 40% of the annual diesel supply in the agricultural operations of a sugarcane biorefinery and still provide approximately 14MWh annually from cogeneration. An environmental assessment demonstrated significant savings in terms of greenhouse gas emissions that could financially benefit the biorefineries due to carbon credit commercialization. Such revenue would be more than enough to cover the operational costs of an anaerobic digestion plant. A global economic analysis revealed that the application of biogas as a diesel replacement would be the most attractive alternative for a sugarcane biorefinery with anaerobic digestion of vinasse.", "key_words": ["Vinasse", "Anaerobic digestion", "Biogas", "Sugarcane", "Biorefinery", "Environmental impacts"], "scp_id": "84883807347"}

This data is relevant to the safety scenario of a sudden leak in a high-pressure hydrogen containment vessel and will provide a technological basis for determining hazardous length scales associated with unintended hydrogen releases at storage and distribution centers. Jet flames originating from high-pressure sources up to 413bar (6000psi) were studied to verify the application of correlations and scaling laws based on lower-pressure subsonic and choked-flow jet flames. These higher pressures are expected to be typical of the pressure ranges in future hydrogen storage vessels. At these pressures the flows exiting the jet nozzle are categorized as underexpanded jets in which the flow is choked at the jet exit. Additionally, the gas behavior departs from that of an ideal-gas and alternate formulations for non-ideal gas must be introduced. Visible flame emission was recorded on video to evaluate flame length and structure. Radiometer measurements allowed determination of the radiant heat flux characteristics. The flame length results show that lower-pressure engineering correlations, based on the Froude number and a non-dimensional flame length, also apply to releases up to 413bar (6000psi). Similarly, radiative heat flux characteristics of these high-pressure jet flames obey scaling laws developed for low-pressure, smaller-scale flames and a wide variety of fuels. The results verify that such correlations can be used to a priori predict dimensional characteristics and radiative heat flux from a wide variety of hydrogen-jet flames resulting from accidental releases.\n               ", "key_words": ["Hydrogen", "Turbulent jet", "Combustion", "Hydrogen flames"], "affil": [{"affilname": "Sandia National Laboratories, California", "contry": "United States"}, {"affilname": "SRI International", "contry": "United States"}], "citedby_count": "125"}

The appearance of secondary recirculation zones and suppression of the vortical core as a consequence of geometrical constrictions are presented as a mechanism of flow control.

Inspired by the mating process of different bird species, bird mating optimizer (BMO) is a new invented search technique which has shown superior performance for solving complex optimization problems. In this paper, the original BMO algorithm is simplified and used to estimate the electrical parameters of the module model for an amorphous silicon PV system at different operating conditions. The simplified BMO (SBMO) eliminates tedious efforts of parameter setting in original BMO and also modifies some rules. The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is investigated by comparing the obtained results with those found by two particle swarm optimization (PSO) variants, two harmony search (HS) variants as well as seeker optimization algorithm (SOA).

Melt infiltration of LiBH4 in ACNF is improved with the increment of SBET and Vtot. Due to effective melt infiltration, not only high hydrogen content desorbed (up to 81% of theoretical capacity), but also the release of B2H6 is suppressed. All nanoconfined LiBH4 in ACNF show the main dehydrogenation at comparable temperature of 347–352 °C, implying that kinetic improvement is mainly from catalytic effects of carbon surface. However, effective nanoconfinement yields considerable reduction of onset and main dehydrogenation temperatures to 275 and 305 °C, respectively (ΔT = 125 and 170 °C, respectively, as compared with bulk LiBH4). Via re-melting the as-prepared sample, further melt infiltration of LiBH4 into voids and/or small pores of ACNF can be obtained. The latter leads to closer contact and more interaction with carbon surface, resulting in the reduction of onset dehydrogenation temperature toward 268 °C and the enhancement of relative content of hydrogen released at low temperature (305 °C).
